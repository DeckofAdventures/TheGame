# Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics

## What is Deck of Adventures?

Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where friends tell a
collaborative narrative story together. This guide is enough to get started, but we
recommended you read the Full Players Guide to learn all of the rules, mechanics, and
story-telling devices. 

## Quick-Start Guide

Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part.
The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the
more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant.

### The Deck

Grab a **deck of playing cards**, reserving the Jokers, and shuffle well. Cards will be
drawn from this deck and make their way to a Discard Pile.

### Checks

If your character attempts an action with an unknown outcome, you'll be asked to make
a **Check**, which involves drawing one more cards from your deck, and comparing the
outcome via...

- A *Target Card* (TC) that is drawn and shown on the table, which you hope to Draw a
  value close to in order to succeed on your Check. Think of it as the bullseye of
  the target you are aiming for.

- *Difficulty Range* (DR) that defines how far away from the TC you can be and still
  succeed. Think of it as the closest rings surrounding the bullseye. A DR 'above' a 
  King is an Ace, then 2, and so on. A DR 'below' 2 is an Ace, then King, etc.

- A *Modifier* (Mod) provided by your character sheet, that allows you to add or
  subtract from the card you draw to get closer to the TC. This helps you aim your
  Check closer to the bullseye.

- Under some circumstances, you'll be asked to draw with the Upper Hand or the Lower 
  Hand.
   - With the Upper Hand, you can draw an additional card(s) and use the more
     favorable value to increase your odds.
   - With the Lower Hand, you must draw an additional card(s) and use the less
     favorable value, decreasing your odds.
   - A single instance of Upper Hand or Lower Hand requires you to draw just 1
     additional card. However, these effects can compound, requiring you to draw 2
     or more cards for the applicable check. Upper and Lower Hand can also cancel
     each other out.

- For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5 to
  succeed on a Check. If you have a +1 Mod, you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a
  successful 3 or 5 draw.

### Fate Cards

You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as **Fate Cards**. Any Aces drawn during play are
also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and
take the new value, you can discard a Fate Card to regenerate one *Fate Point*, or you can discard a Fate Card during combat to nullify one
damage.

### Characters

You will have a **Character Sheet** with all the information about your character. This
includes Attributes (general skills, like Agility and Intelligence), and specific
Skills under each attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility). Each Attribute and Skill has
a Modifier that you add when performing a Check related to that Attribute or Skill,
signified by a number like +1.

Also on your character sheet are **Powers**. This is anything your character can do
that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or
2 *Fate Points* respectively to activate. Your character sheet shows your starting
number of Fate Points as your maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many Fate
Points you have left as you use Powers.

### Gameplay

Throughout a session, your GM will describe scenes and may provide visual cues or
props. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure out what your character
would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact rules) is encouraged.

The GM might announce an **Epic Event**, a series of trials in a tense scenario.

- The GM will reveal a TC and DR. One or more players can volunteer and decide the
  relevant check.

- Each player and the GM will take turns drawing on the TC to get a success with a
  matching suit.

- Each TC is a collective success or failure.

### Resting

Your character may need to rest to recharge Fate Points or heal Health Points.

- On a **Quick Rest** (30 minutes), each player can draw a number of **Rest Cards**.
  - Each Rest Card can regain 1 Health or Fate Point, or be used to regain Armor Points.
  - If the card drawn is the same as the character's Primary Suit, there are additional
    benefits. Reference the Full Guide for more details on taking a Quick Rest.

- On a **Full Rest** you replenish all expended Health, Fate, and Armor. 
   - If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may
     shuffle, but must always draw with Lower Hand (1+) until your next Rest.
     This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day.
   - Return all Aces to the deck, and Jokers to your hand and **shuffle**. Some GMs may also ask for shuffling on Quick Rests.

### Combat

If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning 
of Combat, where each involved character will draw a Target Card to determine turn order.

- On your turn, you can move and take up to 1 Major and 1 Minor Action, in any order.
  Minor actions include object interactions and some Skill Checks.
- Your movement is limited by the Speed value on your character sheet, showing the
  maximum number of spaces you can move on a grid. The average speed is 6. 
- Your character sheet will give you optional actions that you can take listed under
  Powers, but you can always try something new. Ask your GM if your idea is possible
  under circumstances. 
- If you get hit, you can expend a Fate card to nullify 1 point of damage.
- Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked
  Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to undo this effect. For a full list
  of effects and their rules, consult the Full Players Guide.
