# Character Creation

## Decide Your Background

First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that
would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a 'racial' or species origin
(e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. 
This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character
navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport, your character might be more
adept at sailing (i.e., certain skill checks) than others. Coming to a new land as an
outsider might be a [Vulnerability](#Choose-Your-Vulnerabilities), as described below.

Characters beginning their journey at level 1 are relatively unskilled. They may have 
had one profession for many years, but should not have any significant experience 
adventuring or traveling beyond the borders of the comfort zone shared by their peers.

## Choose Your Role

Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might
apply force, a Caster might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Role grants you
access to specific upgrades, called Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in
combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must
forfeit Powers with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent.

- Defender
  - Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus
  more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess
  with!
  - Primary Skill: Brute
  - Suggested Suit: Clubs ♣️ / Defense 🛡
- Support
   - Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or
   other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the
   support of our friends.
   - Primary Skill: Craft
   - Suggested Suit: Hearts ♥️ / Life ❤️‍
- Martial
   - Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons
   to directly damage enemies. Agile and light on their feet!
   - Primary Skill: Finesse
   - Suggested Suit: Spades ♠️ / Offense 🤛
- Caster
   - Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techno-wizards of a much more
   mundane world. Their intellect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely
   comprehend.
   - Primary Skill: Knowledge
   - Suggested Suit: Diamonds ♦️ / Conjuring ⚡️

## Using Experience Points (XP)

Both at character creation (6) and at the GM's discretion for each level up (3), you are
awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an
Attribute, a Skill, add to the Powers you know, or remove a Vulnerability. Total XP is
equal to 6 + (level * 3).

### Choose Your Powers

Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield,
covering simple abilities like swinging a weapon to complicated magical feats. Some
Powers require a specific Role, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill
Modifiers.

Each Power has an associated XP cost. Passive mechanics, or Minor magical tricks
typically cost 1 XP. Big, character-altering feats will cost more. Major Powers are
tiresome and require a limited resource to use: Fate Points(FP). Each Power will list
the range of FP that can be spent (e.g., 1 FP to target one enemy vs. 2 FP to target
multiple). The more FP spent, the bigger the effect. Numbers separated by `/` in the
mechanics description indicate different effects depending on FP spent.

Adding a Power with an FP cost raises the character's maximum FP by the largest number
of FP listed for that Power. FP are replenished on a [Rest]
(01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Rests).

Unless otherwise noted, Powers take one action to perform and use a Dealer's Primary
Skill Modifier. Unless otherwise noted, Powers with duration (e.g., an activated
shield) may only be used one at a time. Using a second Power will nullify the effects
of the first. Powers described as Passive take no action and are always in effect.
Unless otherwise noted, Powers deal 1 damage.

Power types:
- **Passive**: always in effect.
- **Minor**
   + One action.
   + No cost to use.
- **Major**: 
   + One action.
   + Fate Point (FP) cost to use. 
   + Adds maximum FP value to character's FP maximum.

### Choose Your Vulnerabilities

People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship
with the world. At character creation you can choose up to four Vulnerabilities, which
add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim.
Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points
during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 (Minor) or 2
(Major) Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during
character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the
story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability.

Vulnerability types:
- **Minor**: Adds 1 XP
- **Major**: Adds 2 XP

Some Vulnerabilities are either Minor or Major, depending on the effects you choose.

### Changing Attributes and Skills

All Attributes and Skills start at a 0 Modifier. You can adjust your Skills and
Attributes using your Experience Points (XP), which will help define how capable your
character for relevant actions. On initial character creation, you can spend or earn
points by increasing or decreasing Attributes and Skill Modifiers up to -2 or +2. This
upper limit increases as you level up (see table below). Once modifiers are set at
character creation, a player may only add newly awarded Experience points.

**Mod Cap by Level**
| Level | SkillCap |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 1     | 2        |
| 2     | 2        |
| 3     | 3        |
| 4     | 3        |
| 5     | 3        |
| 6     | 4        |
| 7     | 5        |
| 8     | 5        |
| 9     | 5        |
| 10    | 6        |

The lower limit for Modifiers is -2. If -1, any Check made with that modifier must be 
be a Color Match for success. If -2, any Check made with that modifier must be Suit 
Match for success.

Raising an Attribute Modifier by +1 initially costs 2 Experience Points. Raising a Skill
Modifier by +1 initially costs +1 Experience Point. In both cases, raising
modifiers becomes more costly as you add. The table below shows the cost in
Experience Points and the resulting modifier for Attributes and Skills.

**XP Cost for Attributes (left) and Skills (Right)**
| XP Cost | Atrib<br />Mod | XP Cost | Skill<br />Mod |
|  :---:  |    :---:       |  :---:  |    :---:       |
|     -4  | -2             |     -2  | -2             |
|     -2  | -1             |     -1  | -1             |
|     0   | 0              |     0   | 0              |
|     2   | 1              |     1   | 1              |
|     4   | 2              |     2   | 2              |
|     8   | 3              |     4   | 3              |
|     12  | 4              |     6   | 4              |
|     18  | 5              |     9   | 5              |
|     24  | 6              |     12  | 6              |
