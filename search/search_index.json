This guide is enough to get started, but we recommended you read the Full Players Guide to learn all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices. Quick-Start Guide \u00b6 Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part. The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant. The Deck \u00b6 Grab a deck of playing cards , reserving the Jokers, and shuffle well. Cards will be drawn from this deck and make their way to a Discard Pile. Checks \u00b6 If your character attempts an action with an unknown outcome, you'll be asked to make a Check , which involves drawing one more cards from your deck, and comparing the outcome via... A Target Card (TC) that is drawn and shown on the table, which you hope to Draw a value close to in order to succeed on your Check. Think of it as the bullseye of the target you are aiming for. Difficulty Range (DR) that defines how far away from the TC you can be and still succeed. Think of it as the closest rings surrounding the bullseye. A DR 'above' a King is an Ace, then 2, and so on. A DR 'below' 2 is an Ace, then King, etc. A Modifier (Mod) provided by your character sheet, that allows you to add that number to the DR, making it easier for you to succeed. This helps you aim your Check closer to the bullseye. Under some circumstances, you'll be asked to draw with the Upper Hand or the Lower Hand. With the Upper Hand, you can draw an additional card(s) and use the more favorable value to increase your odds. With the Lower Hand, you must draw an additional card(s) and use the less favorable value, decreasing your odds. A single instance of Upper Hand or Lower Hand requires you to draw just 1 additional card. However, these effects can compound, requiring you to draw 2 or more cards for the applicable check. Upper and Lower Hand can also cancel each other out. For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5 to succeed on a Check. If you have a +1 Mod, the DR is 2 and you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a successful 3 or 5 draw. Fate Cards \u00b6 You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as Fate Cards . Any Aces drawn during play are also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and take the new value, you can discard a Fate Card to regenerate one Power Point , or you can discard a Fate Card during combat to nullify one damage. Characters \u00b6 You will have a Character Sheet with all the information about your character. This includes Attributes (general skills, like Agility and Intelligence), and specific Skills under each attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility). Each Attribute and Skill has a Modifier that you add when performing a Check related to that Attribute or Skill, signified by a number like +1. Also on your character sheet are Powers . This is anything your character can do that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or 2 Power Points respectively to activate. Your character sheet shows your starting number of Power Points as your maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many Fate Points you have left as you use Powers. Gameplay \u00b6 Throughout a session, your GM will describe scenes and may provide visual cues or props. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure out what your character would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact rules) is encouraged. The GM might announce an Epic Event , a series of trials in a tense scenario. The GM will reveal a TC and DR. One or more players can volunteer and decide which skill they want to use for the relevant check. Each player and the GM will take turns drawing on the TC to get a success with a matching suit. Each TC is a collective success or failure. Resting \u00b6 Your character may need to rest to recharge Power Points or heal Health Points. On a Quick Rest (30 minutes), each player can draw a number of Rest Cards . Each Rest Card can regain 1 Health or Power Point, or be used to regain Armor Points. If the card drawn is the same as the character's Primary Suit, there are additional benefits. Reference the Full Guide for more details on taking a Quick Rest. On a Full Rest you replenish all expended Health, Fate, and Armor. If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may shuffle, but must always draw with Lower Hand (1+) until your next Rest. This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day. Return all Aces to the deck, and Jokers to your hand and shuffle . Some GMs may also ask for shuffling on Quick Rests. Combat \u00b6 If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning of Combat, where each involved character will draw a Target Card to determine turn order. On your turn, you can move and take up to 1 Major and 1 Minor Action, in any order. Minor actions include object interactions and some Skill Checks. Your movement is limited by the Speed value on your character sheet, showing the maximum number of spaces you can move. The average speed is 6. Your character sheet will give you optional actions that you can take listed under Powers, but you can always try something new. Ask your GM if your idea is possible under circumstances. If you get hit, you can expend a Fate card to nullify 1 point of damage. Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to undo this effect. For a full list of effects and their rules, consult the Full Players Guide. Have Fun! \u00b6 You're now ready to play your first game of Deck of Adventures! Remember: having fun comes first.","title":"Brief Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Brief/#deck-of-adventures-core-mechanics","text":"","title":"Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Brief/#what-is-deck-of-adventures","text":"Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where friends tell a collaborative narrative story together.

If you have a +1 Mod, the DR is 2 and you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a successful 3 or 5 draw.","title":"Checks"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Brief/#fate-cards","text":"You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as Fate Cards .

Remember: having fun comes first.","title":"Have Fun!"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/","text":"Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics \u00b6 Full Player's Guide \u00b6 What is a Tabletop Game System? \u00b6 A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player\u2019s success and failure, and guides the group in a meaningful way. Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things. Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards. While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action, Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck. Guiding Principles \u00b6 In times of uncertainty, defer to the following: Have fun. The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to ensure the entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and will work to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up. The Action Deck \u00b6 Deck of Adventures is based around a 54-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A) across 4 suits, as well as Jokers. Each player should have their own Deck, with room for a Discard Pile and Fate Card pile. Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a Check, which means drawing from their respective decks to inform the outcome. Jokers and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, for both players and the GM. All other cards go directly into a Discard Pile. Hold on to these Fate Cards, even when shuffling the deck. Players will use their deck to do most anything; it represents their character's stamina until they complete a Rest. When the Action Deck is empty and a player has to shuffle between rests, they draw with the Lower Hand (1+) until they would shuffle when resting. Fate Cards \u00b6 Fate Cards (Jokers and Aces) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player to choose when they want a second chance at a key moment. After a Full Rest, Jokers return to the player's hand as Fate Cards, if they're not there already. Aces drawn from the deck are played as usual, but remains in the player's hand as a Fate Card rather than going to the Discard Pile. Any time a player or the GM draws a card, they may discard one held Fate Card and redraw. Only one redraw is permitted per check. Fate Cards may also be expended to either ... Toughen Up : ignore damage equal to the number of Fate Cards used. This must be done before the end of the Player's next turn after recieving damage. Exchange Fate : gain Power Points equal to the number of Fate Cards used. A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the player's discard pile or signified by another token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character\u2019s strengths or weaknesses. Characters \u00b6 Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers \u00b6 Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality. Skills are specific to an Attribute. These signify how good a character is at performing certain types of actions. Each Skill is tied to an Attribute, meaning improving that Attribute also increases the effectiveness of a related Skill. Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a Conviction skill. All Attributes and Skills are listed below. Modifiers reflect a character\u2019s level of expertise given Attribute or Skill domain and allow you to add that number to the DR when making a Check. These modifiers are determined at Character Creation and can be improved as you Level Up. Complete Attribute and Skill List: Agility AGL Finesse (Fight) Stealth Conviction CON Bluffing Performance Intuition GUT Detection Craft Intelligence INT Knowledge Investigation Strength STR Athletics Brute (Fight) Vitality VIT Each skill is generally related to a domain of expertise a character may possess. A GM might call for a Check using a specific Skill, but you can always ask if another would be applicable in the situation. The GM decides whether the Skill applies, so get creative! Dealers, Bystanders, Minions and Companions \u00b6 The Player Characters (PCs) are typically the heroes of the story. PCs are considered Dealers and differ from the majority of other characters in the world. The GM may control other Dealers who can take the form of powerful allies or adversaries the players may encounter along the way. Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters that are controlled by the Game Master. They... Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities. Have at least 5 health points (HP). Draw from their own deck of cards. Can receive and use Fate Cards. Have a Primary Suit, and related mechanics. Bystanders and Minions. All other characters. They... Are weaker than Dealers Have limited access to Powers Have 1-3 HP. Draw from a collective set of cards controlled by the GM. Cannot use either Fate Cards or Primary Suit features. Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or other-worldly advisor. A Companion acts on the players turn, draws from the Dealer's deck of cards, and grants unique features in and out of combat. See the setting Bestiary for a list of potential Companions and their unique features. Playing the Game \u00b6 Exploration and Adventuring \u00b6 The players are creating and experiencing the world at the same time. Adventures can include exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging in social interactions with other players and non-playable characters. During an Adventure, the GM will ask players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier relevant to the circumstance. Setting the Scene. The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players are encouraged to ask clarifying questions. What do I see? Characters often know more just by having direct access to the world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a character might have. The GM\u2019s answer may depend on a successful check. Talking to the Locals. The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse to be rude to one\u2019s fellow players. Making a Check \u00b6 When the GM or a Player calls for a Check, they announce who will be making this check and reveal (a) a Target Card (TC), (b) the Attribute or Skill associated with the check, and (c) the Difficulty Range (DR). A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like the circles around the bullseye. Once the DR has been announced, players must make the check. Players may consult with their GM to determine if another Attribute or Skill may be used instead. A player will draw one or more cards. Immediately after drawing, a player will apply any relevant Modifiers before reporting the outcome and whether or not they have successfully fallen within the DR. A Modifier is the maximum value a player may add or subtract; this is usually done to get closer to the TC. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet next to the relevant Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a character's ability to 'aim' a check to get closer to the TC. The GM may describe the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success and ask the player to describe how their character successfully accomplishes the action. Because the range of cards is circular (Q, K, A, 2, 3, etc.), success is all about dialing in your effort to match the task at hand as closely as possible. Remembering which card is 5 below a 3 can be tough, so there is a table below as well as a printable tool to help look up the DR range as you get familiar with the system. Target Card Range Table For each card on the left, refer to the column with the corresponding DR. Left of 0 is the lower bound, right of 0 is the upper bound. TC -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 A 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J 6 K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q 7 A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 9 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 10 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 J 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 Q 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 K 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 Degrees of Success \u00b6 Exactly matching the TC in numeric value, is a Major Success. If the drawn card is a perfect match (i.e., value and suit), it's a Critical Success. If the card drawn is within the DR and matches the suit or color (i.e., red/black), it is either a Suited or Color Success. If there is a suit or color match outside the DR after the modifier has been applied, this is a Suited or Color Miss. Suit and Color will only matter under specific circumstances; for certain character Powers, item types or defenses. There is no critical failure in Deck of Adventures. For example , when Xena attempts to jump across a chasm, the GM reveals a TC of the 8 of Clubs and a DR of 2, asking for an Athletics check. If the player's Athletics modifier is +1, the check is ... A Critical Success if they draw the 8 of Clubs. They might perfectly make the jump, impressing their allies, and catch a glimpse of something important in the distance. A Major Success if they draw any 8. They might make the jump gracefully enough to impress their allies without any other perks. A Success if they draw any card within 3 (DR 2 \u00b1 1 Mod). For TC 8, DR 1, and Mod 1, this is 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 or J. If Xena draws a J, they may subtract 1 to report a 10, within the DR. A Color Success for any Successes that match the color of the TC. A Suited Success for any Successes that match the Suit of the TC. Xena might have a Power that grants benefits to allies on a Suited Success. After crossing, they can improve their ally's chances of crossing. A Suited or Color Miss if they draw any Club or Spade, respectively below 5 or above J. Xena might have a Power that lets them redraw on a Suited Miss, for example. A Miss is any Diamond or Heart draw below 5 or above J. Upper and Lower Hand \u00b6 Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you. Having the Upper Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card closest to the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A player may choose to stop drawing before N cards are drawn. Having the Lower Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card that is furthest from the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A play must draw all N cards. In these cases, the other card is discarded. If N is not specified, draw 1 extra. Multiple Upper/Lower hand effects can compound or even out. If a rule specifies Upper/Lower Hand (N+), the effect can apply multiple times. N cards are drawn, +1 for each instance the effect is applied. For example, running through your Action Deck without resting is Lower Hand (1+). This means that, if it happens twice, draw 3. If another effect would also cause drawing with Lower Hand, draw 4. Contested Checks \u00b6 Some checks will be initiated by a character's actions and require others to respond, pitting two skills against each other. This might be one character sneaking past another (e.g., Stealth vs. Detection), or one character causing a magical effect that another tries to dodge (e.g., Craft vs. Agility). This is a Contested Check. In these cases, the character who initiated the action (i.e., the Attacker) reveals a TC and sets the DR; the DR for a Contested Check is 3 minus half of the Attacker's relevant modifier, to a minimum of 0. The character(s) responding are the Target(s). Rules that describe a \"Contested X Check vs. Y\" use the attacker's Skill X and Targets' Y. Targets succeed or fail individually. For example, Xena attempts to convince Jonas of something (either truthfully or with deception), they would use their Bluffing Mod of +1, setting the DR to 3 (4-1). They draw a TC of 3 of Diamonds, permitting a card between A and 6. Jonas draws an 8 of Spades with a +1 Modifier to Detection and reports a 7, still outside the DR. Xena would successfully convince Jonas of something in this scenario. In Combat \u00b6 Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. The GM decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. Combat in Deck of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while leaving a lot of room for player teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players should be sure to study their character sheets and know their options ahead of combat, and use others\u2019 turns to make their choices. Deck of Adventures is all about teamwork, so communication is encouraged. GMs may provide a map and other visual cues like character tokens to help players visualize the situation. On a square grid, moving diagonally counts as one space unless otherwise ruled by the GM. In combat, a Critical Success has an additional effect. Damaging or Healing actions deal or return 1 additional damage to the target. Other actions will grant benefits at the GM's discretion. Taking Turns \u00b6 Combat order is determined by card draw. At the beginning of combat, all characters draw a Target Card and place it in on the table in view. The values represent the turn order (Ace first, then K, Q, etc.) and the TC for any attack. Players with the same Target Card values as an enemy go first. If two players draw the same Target Card, they can decide who goes first. Without consensus, the player with the higher Agility modifier goes first. A player may delay their turn in initiative order to intentionally occur before or after another player(s)', but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their action(s) by the end of the round. A GM may skip a player\u2019s turn if they are unprepared and need more time to think. In Combat Actions \u00b6 Each turn represents 6 seconds of game time passing. On a turn, a character may (a) move, (b) perform 1 Major Action, and/or (c) perform 1 Minor Action in any order they choose. They may also perform any number of Free Actions, within reason, as permitted by the GM. Movement By default, character speed is equal to 6, but may be faster or slower. Speed is the total number of spaces a character can move in a turn. This total may be split to occur before, after, and/or between actions. A creature can move through a friendly creature's space as part of their movement but can not end their turn on that space. A creature cannot move through a hostile creature's space or between two hostile creatures' spaces if they are within one space of one another. Actions The list below are possible Minor/Major Actions, but a GM may permit others. If an action specifies a skill, this requires a check. Free Communication that does not require a check. Observation : gaining obvious information about the world. Toughening Up : discard one or more Fate Cards to nullify one damage per card used. Exchanging Fate : discard one or more Fate Cards to gain one Power Point per card used. Minor Object interaction : Pressing a button, pulling a lever, using a disposable item, equipping or changing weapons, etc. Inspect : Detection or Investigation vs. GM-determined DR; learn something about an opponent or the terrain. Convince : Bluffing vs. GM-determined DR; convince a target to change their course of action Recall : Knowledge vs. GM-determined DR; determine if a character knows a specific piece of information Major Rush : double movement Grapple : Brute vs. target Finesse or Brute; cause one creature to be entangled Hide : Stealth vs. target(s) Detection; impose Lower Hand on attacks against you by target(s) who failed Ending Combat \u00b6 When the last enemy combatant has been Knocked Out, retreats, or surrenders, Combat is over. This ends the turn order, and characters can act independently of turn order. Characters do not discard their Target Cards after combat ends. This TC represents the character until the start of the next combat. Status Conditions \u00b6 Some Status Conditions will impact a character over time. The duration of each Condition is listed in the Power or effect that causes it. Stunned If a Dealer is hit by a critical attack, they make a DR 3 Conviction Check at the start of their turn vs their own TC. If failed, they may either move or make one Action on their turn, not both. Some creatures can cause the Stunned Condition as part of their attacks. Entangled A Dealer may expend a Major Action to make a DR 3 Strength check. Until they are successful, they may not move and any Agility Checks are made with Lower Hand. Knocked Down A Dealer must expend a Minor Action to get up. Their movement speed is halved, rounding up. All Strength and Agility Checks are made with Lower Hand. When Knocked Down, attackers within 1 space draw with Upper Hand and attackers further than 1 space away draw with Lower Hand. A creature can spend 1 speed to willingly go prone as part of their movement, gaining the Knocked Down status. Blinded, Deafened At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a DR 3 Intuition Check vs. their TC. If they fail, they draw Lower Hand (3) for any action requiring the relevant sense. Knocked Out Knocked Out (KO) Dealers are unable to act until treated by a Craft check or a Healing Power (DR 5 vs. the KO Dealer's TC, minus 1 for each turn passed since the effect onset). If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, the player begins an Epic Event alone. Burned As a Minor Action, a Dealer can make a DR 3 Intuition check to stop the burning. On a failure, they take 1 damage bypassing AP. Poisoned N Each poisoning effect adds +1 Poisoned. At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a Dealer makes a DR 3 Vitality Check to shake off the effects of the poison. On a failure, they discard N+1 cards. Frozen Movement speed is reduced by half and all skill checks are drawn at Lower Hand. A Dealer makes a DR 3 Strength Check as a Free Action at the end of their turn to attempt to end the freeze. Health and Armor \u00b6 Dealers have 4 health points (HP) plus their level, plus Vitality modifier. The health of Companions HP is half the level of their Dealer, rounding up. If a character is wounded beyond their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor Points (AP) are an additional resource that would be removed first in the event of a physical wound. Armor Range (AR) is how hard you are to hit in general and sets the DR for an attack against you. Without armor, this is 3 minus half of your Agility modifier rounded down. If you have physical armor or an armor-like magical effect, this determines your AR depending on the type of armor. Some armor has strength requirements which, if unmet, will cut a character's speed in half. Some armor can possess special effects, like granting bonuses to certain checks or requiring hits to color-match. Physical shields and magical effects can grant AP, either when equipping the item or activating the Power. Unless otherwise specified, damage subtracts from AP first. After AP is depleted, additional damage subtracts from HP. Unless otherwise noted, no two pieces of armor may be worn at the same time. Armor Table Type AR AP Prerequisite Basic 3 0 Light 3 0 Medium 2 0 Fortified 2 1 Strength \u2265 0 Heavy 1 2 Strength \u2265 1 Massive 1 3 Strength \u2265 2 Gleaming 1 2 Agility \u2265 3 Epic Events \u00b6 At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event. The GM will narrate a particularly tense scenario and the player(s) must navigate the challenge. This usually involves player(s) needing to make a series of successes in a short time period. During an Epic Event... The GM draws a TC related to a specific task during the event. The GM determines the total number of TCs and the amount of successes or failures needed to complete the Epic Event. One or more players may announce how they would attempt this task. The GM decides the relevant Attribute or Skill, so each player may apply the relevant modifier. The GM applies no modifier. Each player involved and the GM take turns drawing on this TC, looking for a Suited Hit. If a player succeeds first, this is a success for the party. If the GM succeeds first, this is a failure. This process repeats for each TC in the Epic Event. A player may not volunteer for sequential TCs. Just as in standard Checks, a failure may be associated with some drawbacks. Successive failures could change the course of the story. Fate Cards card mechanics still apply: played As return to the player\u2019s hand. Players may use Fate Cards for redraws. For example , an earthquake causes a cavern to shake. The party must act quickly to get out before a collapse The GM reveals a TC: a 4 of Hearts, with DR 4. How will the party navigate their way to safety? Xena and Elise both volunteer for this TC. Xena will attempt to remember the way back, and will be making Knowledge Checks. Elise is a skilled survivalist, with experience in rock formations, and will be making Craft Checks. Xena draws a 3 of Spades with +0 Mod. This is within the DR, but not a Suited Match. Elise draws a 9 of Hearts with a +1 Mod. This is a Suited Match, the group makes good headway. The GM reveals a new TC: a K of Spades, with DR 3. A cultist blocks their path. Genesis volunteers to distract the cultists, using Performance Checks. Genesis and the GM each draw: Genesis, then the GM, then Genesis, then the GM, etc. Finally, the GM draws a Q of Spades. The cultist sees the remaining party members. The GM reveals a new TC, DR 2. All party members must make Athletics checks to outrun the cultist. When a Dealer is Knocked Out in combat, their subsequent turns are replaced with Epic Event TCs of DR 4 Vitality Checks. If they take additional damage, they make these checks at Lower Hand (+1). If they succeed on two TCs, they remain unconscious and the Epic Event is concluded. For a Major Success (same value as TC), they recover 1 HP. For a Critical Success, they recover 1 HP and up to 3 PP (PP max permitting). If they fail two of these TCs, they are called to the great beyond. Rests \u00b6 Rests are common throughout a session. There are two types of rests. A Quick Rest represents a short 30-minute break, where characters may be catching their breath or healing their wounds. A Full Rest is an 8-hour period of time where characters get some sleep and recover from a long day. During a Quick Rest, each player who is resting draw from their deck using Rest Cards. Players start with a number of Rest Cards equal to the sum of their maximum Health and Power Points. Each Rest Cards drawn regains 1 Health or Power Point. If the card drawn is the same as the players's Primary Suit, regain an additional 1 Health or Power Point. To recover Armor Points, a player may expend one Rest Card to make a Craft or Knowledge Skill check of DR 7 minus the number of points they are attempting to recover. If the Rest Card drawn matches they player's Primary Suit, make this check at Upper Hand. For standard play, Shuffle your discard pile back into your deck after completing a Quick Rest. For hardcore play, continue without shuffling. After completing a Full Rest, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck, along with any Aces from your hand. Add both Jokers to your hand as Fate Cards if they were used. Fate, Health, and Armor Points all return to their maximum. Rest Cards return to their full value after a Full Rest. If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you suffer one level of Fatigue . Reshuffle your deck and draw all Checks with the Lower Hand. Each time you need to reshuffle your deck in this way adds another level of Fatigue. If you were to suffer a fourth level of Fatigue, you are Knocked Out instead. This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day. Discard Mechanics \u00b6 Each Dealer may have an additional Burn Mechanic. Dealers may discard cards as a Minor Action for additional benefits in combat starting at Level 2. For every 2 cards discarded, up to a limit of 4, an Upper/Lower Hand +1 is granted described below. These effects do not stack; only one may be applied to a character at a time. Below is a list of possible Discard Mechanics, determined by Role. Work with your GM if you would like to use a different Burn Mechanic instead. Clubs \u2663\ufe0f, Aggro: Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits. They can choose to bury N cards to force all creatures within 2 spaces to make their next Check to attack targets besides the Defense Dealer at Lower Hand (N/2). Diamonds \u2666\ufe0f, Intensify: Casters Dealers have explosive damage but they run out of gas really fast. They can choose to burn N cards to make their next Check at Upper Hand (N/2). Hearts \u2665\ufe0f, Help: Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they are within 6 spaces of an ally, they may toss 2 cards to grant their ally Upper Hand(N/2) on their next draw. Spades \u2660\ufe0f, Thwart: Offense Dealers deploy all sorts of mechanisms for drawing the eye of enemies away from their allies. They can scrap N cards and cause an enemy to make Checks at Lower Hand (N/2) until the start of the Offense Dealer's next turn. The discard limit increases with level according to the table below. Level Discard Cap Bonus 1 4 2 5 6 3 8 8 4 Interacting with the Environment \u00b6 Light and Vision \u00b6 Certain types of Checks require light and vision to see the environment or a target effectively. The amount of light available impacts Checks for most creatures. There are some Powers that affect a creature's abilities depending on the amount of light available. Partial Darkness: When making a Detection or Investigation Check in partial darkness, draw with the Lower Hand. For example... A dark alley in a city with some light spilling over from a nearby street. An underground room with some candles burning lightly. Full Darkness: When making a Detection or Investigation Check in full darkness, draw with the Lower Hand (3). For example... A moonless night in the countryside without any light source. Descending into a cave without a light source. Cover \u00b6 When a creature moves to a position that makes it more difficult to hit them, they will gain the effects of cover. Partially Covered : When a creature is still visible behind something but it is still reasonable to hit them. While partially covered the creature gains +1 AR. For example... Standing directly between another creature and an attacker. Standing behind a crate or barrel that is half the creature's height. Fully Covered : when a creature is nearly impossible to see behind something and it is unlikely to land a hit on them. While fully covered, the creature gains +2 AR. For example... Crouching below a crate that is half the creature's height. Standing behind a pillar or wall that is taller than the creature. A creature can go from Fully to Partially Covered or from Fully Covered to Not Covered by using their Speed or making a Check. Some Powers may grant these effects as well. A creature may be covered from one direction but not from another direction. Falling \u00b6 Falling from a great height is dangerous. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1 damage and applies -1 speed for every 2 space equivalent in height it fell and the creature is Knocked Down. This speed is recovered after a Rest or if the creature is healed to their maximum HP. Your GM may allow for an Agility Check to mitigate the penalty from falling. Challenging Terrain \u00b6 Moving through the environment can sometimes be challenging. When navigating through Challenging Terrain , moving through one space requires 2 speed. While standing in Challenging Terrain, all Agility Checks are made with the Lower Hand. Character Creation \u00b6 Deck of Adventures offers both premade characters and a completely customizable process. Consult with your GM for information about the setting and what skills will be relevant for the story ahead. Custom creation starts with spending Experience Points on Attributes, Skills, Powers, Vulnerabilities and/or Skills. A Background is descriptive about of character's history and where they are when you begin your adventure. A Role is a general class the unlocks access to certain abilities. Attributes cost more, but also increase corresponding skills. Spending points has diminishing returns. Going from 0 to +1 is relatively cheap, but +3 to +4 will take many more points. Skill Modifiers start unskilled with a 0 Modifier, so choose carefully. Vulnerabilities are roleplay and/or combat weaknesses and yield 1 or 2 additional Experience Points to spend when they are added to the Character Sheet during Character Creation. Powers are special features, boons or strengths, that cost 1 or 2 points. Powers may have additional requirements such as Role or Level. For a full set of character creation options, see our Character Creation page . Starting your adventure \u00b6 There are four steps to starting an adventure of Deck of Adventures: Find a group: Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master ( GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to the table. Join the Deck of Adventures Discord Server to find a group! (if this link is expired, please submit an issue ) Discuss play style: Different players and GMs will have different preferences. Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided. Choose your adventure: You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures\u2019s standard adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited to make modifications to fit their setting. Pick a time and place: Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20 because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily. To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind... Schedules: Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving forward. Getting on the same page: A good \u2018first\u2019 session discussion topic is the story ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the first official session of play. Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and your's to remember.","title":"Full Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#deck-of-adventures-core-mechanics","text":"","title":"Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#full-players-guide","text":"","title":"Full Player's Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#what-is-a-tabletop-game-system","text":"A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player\u2019s success and failure, and guides the group in a meaningful way. Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things. Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards. While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action, Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck.","title":"What is a Tabletop Game System?"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#guiding-principles","text":"In times of uncertainty, defer to the following: Have fun.

Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a Check, which means drawing from their respective decks to inform the outcome. Jokers and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, for both players and the GM. All other cards go directly into a Discard Pile. Hold on to these Fate Cards, even when shuffling the deck. Players will use their deck to do most anything; it represents their character's stamina until they complete a Rest.

A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like the circles around the bullseye. Once the DR has been announced, players must make the check. Players may consult with their GM to determine if another Attribute or Skill may be used instead. A player will draw one or more cards. Immediately after drawing, a player will apply any relevant Modifiers before reporting the outcome and whether or not they have successfully fallen within the DR. A Modifier is the maximum value a player may add or subtract; this is usually done to get closer to the TC. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet next to the relevant Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a character's ability to 'aim' a check to get closer to the TC. The GM may describe the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success and ask the player to describe how their character successfully accomplishes the action.

If there is a suit or color match outside the DR after the modifier has been applied, this is a Suited or Color Miss. Suit and Color will only matter under specific circumstances; for certain character Powers, item types or defenses. There is no critical failure in Deck of Adventures.

Fully Covered : when a creature is nearly impossible to see behind something and it is unlikely to land a hit on them. While fully covered, the creature gains +2 AR. For example... Crouching below a crate that is half the creature's height. Standing behind a pillar or wall that is taller than the creature. A creature can go from Fully to Partially Covered or from Fully Covered to Not Covered by using their Speed or making a Check. Some Powers may grant these effects as well. A creature may be covered from one direction but not from another direction.","title":"Cover"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full/#falling","text":"Falling from a great height is dangerous.

Join the Deck of Adventures Discord Server to find a group! (if this link is expired, please submit an issue ) Discuss play style: Different players and GMs will have different preferences. Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided. Choose your adventure: You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures\u2019s standard adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited to make modifications to fit their setting. Pick a time and place: Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20 because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily. To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind... Schedules: Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving forward.

An Adventure can last for a single 2-3 hour session, or it can unfold over the course of weeks, months, or even years in a continuous narrative. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends virtually through the Discord . If you\u2019ve been a GM elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what\u2019s different about being a Deck of Adventures Game Master, you can skip right to Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master . For everyone else, or those GMs who want a refresher, we will dive into what being a GM is all about in Getting Started as a Game Master . If you or your players have questions or need a helping hand, please reach out to the team on Discord or via GitHub issues. Getting Started as a Game Master \u00b6 Game Masters (GMs) play referee and narrator in a Tabletop RPG like Deck of Adventures (DofA). You are both the arbiter of the rules, and the actor/playwright who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the majority of the characters who populate the world. You control when certain characters come and go, scene changes, and the narration between scenes. You build the world, populate it with characters and history, and then the Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand. GMs are responsible for preparing ahead of sessions and guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative Adventure. You bring the game to life with any type of story you can imagine. There are so many possibilities as Game Master, and this guide is intended to help GMs develop and hone their skills running Adventures. There are many different approaches GMs take to this role, focusing on their unique strengths and talents. Don't compare yourself to others, especially those with years of experience. This craft takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great GM within your first few sessions by following some of the advice in this guide. The DofA Community also is available to respond to questions and offer advice, drawing from years of collective experience. You should be an impartial force in the world, controlling both allies and enemies neutrally. The best sessions feel like everyone is working together to complete an objective, even the GM, rather than competition between Players and GM. This is a delicate balance, and GMs should ask for Players' feedback. It's also a GM's responsibility to provide feedback to the Players at the table when necessary, especially if one's play style may be a distraction to others at the table. Making Checks \u00b6 As the GM, you decide when characters should make a Check when attempting an action during an Adventure. Some actions just happen, like a character opening an unlocked door. Other actions might require the character to attempt a Skill Check to see if they are successful. Incorporating luck makes Adventures feel more dynamic and exciting. When characters make a Check, they are drawing from their expertise (or inexperience) with a specific Skill to see how they perform. Their Modifier (Mod) indicates their character's expertise with a specific Skill. Characters with high Strength would be more likely to succeed on an Athletics Check than Characters with low Strength, though by incorporating luck a low Strength character still has a chance to succeed on a Strength Check. You determine when a Check should be made, what Skill should be used, and set the Difficulty. A Player might ask if a specific Skill could be used instead, and it is your decision whether to allow it in the circumstance. Stepping over a crack in the floor should not require a Check, but leaping ten feet across a chasm would. Attempting to sneak past a sleeping guard still requires a Stealth Check, but it should be less difficult than sneaking past the same guard who is on high alert. Flow state is achieved when we are at the peak of our ability and met with the exact level of challenge to fit our skills. To keep Players engaged, dial in the difficulty to where they're feeling challenged in a way that suits their play style, without worrying about what resources they have left. GM Preparation \u00b6 As a GM, you will need to spend time outside of normal session hours working on your Adventure. You will be the primary resource for information about the world. Players will ask questions, and it's up to you to provide details, even if it's improvised. It's also OK to say you don't know something, or that you'll need to get back to them after the session. You should be open to Player questions and ideas, and work with them to tell the story as much as possible. Improvisation and spontaneity are two vital ingredients to a great session, but having key moments mapped out is important to shaping the Players' experience. What you prepare may not pan out perfectly, and that's part of the fun. The Players bring their own creative agency to the table, and that can be unpredictable. It's important not to force the Players back into a prescribed narrative. If the Players logically lead the the session in a different direction, go with it. The Players also may not know when story beats are improvised, and these moments can make for the most organic and memorable Adventures. During a session, GMs keep some information hidden from the Players. This can be a physical or virtual GM screen that separates the information that's available to the GM and not the players. Behind the GM screen also serves as a metaphor for what players can and can't see. As the GM, you choose what to share and under what circumstances, as a result of a Check or just part of the narrative. Every GM has their own style of maintaining this division of what is hidden and what is revealed. Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master \u00b6 As a Deck of Adventures (DofA) Game Master (GM) you are controlling the flow of card draws on both sides of the table. Try to balance card draws between Players and NPCs throughout a session, and make sure all Players are involved. Game Master Resources \u00b6 Game Masters (GMs) should have at least two decks of cards available during a session to represent allies and enemies. More decks may be useful to represent different groups in combat. If you only have one deck available, split it into two 26-card decks and shuffle regularly. One deck of cards should be designated the Minion Deck and one designated the World Deck . Different color card backs will help distinguish the two throughout play. The Minion Deck is used during combat and when applying negative Status Conditions . The World Deck is used to draw Target Cards for NPCs, make social checks, and used for drawing a card based on a table out of combat. Before each Combat, reshuffle the Minion Deck. You reshuffle the World Deck when it is empty. Most NPCs won't stick around long enough to use a deck completely, and therefore won't shuffle prematurely, which would invoke Lower Hand on Checks. For the exceptional NPC, such as a Dealer or a Boss, try assigning them a deck, if available. If unavailable, you can decide when to invoke Lower Hand behind the GM screen. Managing Player Resources \u00b6 Adventures can also be designed to test different aspects of the Players and characters. Each Player holds a single deck of 52 cards, with two Fate Cards reserved at the beginning of play. Each character has statistics that include total Health Points (HP), Power Points (PP), and Armor Points (AP). Your focus during a session will be balancing the expenditure of all of these resources. Absolute values are low in Deck of Adventures to promote speed of play and simplicity of calculations. With that in mind, Player controlled Dealer HP starts at 5, but scales with level and Vitality modifier. The theoretical maximum is 21 HP, at level 10 with a +6 Vitality modifier. Armor Points are similarly small, with a maximum of 3. Maximum Power Points may be larger at higher levels of play, the enemies that players face should require higher level Powers that balance out this scaling. Players will leverage all of their resources to survive and succeed in Adventures. As the GM, it is up to you to make those resources feel strained and tested. Cards \u00b6 Think of the Players' decks as their characters' stamina. They should get progressively more tired throughout the day as cards are drawn for Checks and Powers. If a Player runs out of cards between Rests, they are Fatigued and reshuffle their deck. They then make all checks at Lower Hand until they complete a Rest. At lower levels, Players may not reach the end of their decks between Rests to incur Lower Hand penalties. As Players level up, both the Powers they use and the Encounters they face may require more draws, bringing them closer to running out. Some Players will go through cards more quickly than others. Keep this in mind when developing Encounters to challenge different Players. Resting \u00b6 Health and Power Points are also balanced by Rests. Players can take a Quick Rest using 30 minutes of in-game time, or a Full Rest using 8 hours. Depending on the Encounters they face and the resources expended, Players may try to Rest more often. While Resting, the Players will regain their HP and PP, and expending Rest Cards. Keep these resources in mind when planning Encounters that deal damage. Try to keep Players motivated to press on, even without full resources. To Rest, Players will consult with the GM about whether it may be feasible to secure an uninterrupted break. Players can only use Rest Cards after a Rest has been successfully completed. If a situation is tense, it may not always be possible to gain the benefits of a Rest. In the event that a Rest is interrupted, it can be resumed based on the remaining time left and extended as necessary. For example, a Full Rest would be easy to secure at a comfortable inn in a major city. A temporary hiding spot in an enemy bandit camp would me much more risky. You could use (a) a Player Stealth Check (b) an enemy Detection Check, or (c) an Epic Event to see if the Rest is interrupted. As the GM, you have the ultimate authority in the successful completion of a Rest. Encourage players to work with each other to make the best decision given circumstances. Character Vulnerabilities \u00b6 Each character can have one or more Vulnerabilities, which may have mechanical and/or roleplay implications. GMs are highly encouraged to keep these Vulnerabilities in mind when designing Adventures. For Players, these are narrative seeds that can be cultivated into truly meaningful moments for the Players. For Player Vulnerabilities with more severe mechanical consequences, or those that could lead to dangerous situations, GMs should avoid planning too much around this weakness. The Players should feel like their Vulnerabilities add to the richness of the story, and that are ultimately rewarded for taking on the added challenge. A Vulnerability should feel both like an added difficulty and the source of heroism despite the odds. At its best, Vulnerabilities will inspire characters that develop over time, intertwining with a broader narrative. For NPCs, Vulnerabilities can add depth to an otherwise flat archetype of merchant or farmer. Are there Vulnerabilities that can work to challenge the values of Players? What foils can help Players flesh out their character by disagreeing with another character. Seeing a corruptible guard might really activate a character focused on justice. Enemy NPC Vulnerabilities also give Players something to exploit, through deeper analysis of the world. Yes, one Player can do consistent damage by continuing to attack, but another could spend a turn studying movements to learn that their adversary has an injury and can't defend against specific attacks. Perhaps an enemy has specific values or beliefs that could be used to turn them into an ally. Running a Session with Deck of Adventures \u00b6 The Target Card System \u00b6 As a Game Master (GM), you will set up various challenges wherein you or a Player will draw a Target Card (TC), and the other draws against that card to make a Check. The level of difficulty of a Check is set by the Difficulty Range (DR), which is the distance between pip values that will still count as a success. When thinking about the Target Card System, it may be helpful to consider a bullseye, where the TC is the center and the DR is the number of circles away from the center you can hit and still be successful. One of the initial barriers a new GM must overcome is helping the Players understand this target system. As Players get more familiar with the system, speed of play increases, and it is then easier for them to understand more complex mechanics. Using the Circular TC-DR Tool is a helpful visual aid. The Target Card System is circular, so an Ace is only 1 away from both a King and a 2. If you were aiming a Check against a Target Card of an Ace, you could consult the below table to understand which cards would be successful within the set DR. DR -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 Card 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 3 4 5 6 7 Successes and Failures \u00b6 Successes happen when the drawn card is within the DR. The character making the Check is able to accomplish what they intended, within reason. Misses happen when the drawn card is outside the DR. The character making the Check is not able to accomplish what they intended. Critical Successes happen when the drawn card exactly matches the TC in pip value and suit. At 2% chance, they should feel amazing for the Player. Make an effort to reward these exact matches whenever possible with additional effects or bonuses. Major Successes happen when the drawn card matches the TC in pip value At 6% chance, this should feel pretty good. In Combat, a Major Success increases the damage of the attack by 1. Out of combat, some smaller bonus should happen whenever possible. Color and Suited Successes happen when the drawn card is within the DR and matches the TC in color or suit. Fate Cards permit a Dealer (Player character or significant NPC) to redraw. If this changes the success state, the first draw should be ignored. Difficulty Chart \u00b6 As the GM, you set the Difficulty for all Checks made during a session. Setting the Difficulty Range (DR) is the GM's way of establishing how difficult something is to accomplish. The chart below shows probability of success for the most frequent draws at each Difficulty Range (DR). To further dial in the difficulty, you might say that a specific check requires a Color or Suited Success. Note that Color or Suit make success half or a quarter as likely. Some mechanics or GM rulings can call for Checks to be made at Upper or Lower Hand, potentially drawing additional cards, and taking the more or less beneficial result. The final row notes the difference caused by drawing 2 cards. At DR 0 or 6, there's little difference, but it can be as much as 25% for a DR 3 check. DR 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Normal Draw 8% 23% 38% 54% 69% 85% 100% Color Draw 4% 12% 19% 27% 35% 42% 50% Suit Draw 2% 6% 10% 13% 17% 21% 25% Lower Hand 2 1% 5% 15% 29% 48% 72% 100% Upper Hand 2 15% 41% 62% 79% 91% 98% 100% Difference 7% 18% 24% 25% 21% 13% NA Keep this table as a handy reference for setting DRs throughout a session. Do you want something to feel extremely difficult? Maybe make it a DR 1. Should a Player feel like something is less challenging for their character in a moment where the odds are in their favor? Make it a DR 3 with Upper Hand. You decide what makes the most sense given a specific situation. Player Skill Mods and DR Reporting \u00b6 Players will have Modifiers (Mods) on their Character Sheet that allow them to reduce the difficulty of Checks made in the relevant domain. A Modifier widens the DR, making it more likely their draw will be successful. In some circumstances, having a +1 Mod may be the difference between success and failure. Referencing the table above, it's clear to see the difference an additional DR +1 can make. As you progress Players through an Adventure, keep these Modifiers in mind when balancing Encounters and challenges. A Player with a +3 Mod facing a DR 3 Check is an automatic success on a Normal Draw. Scale difficulties up or down accordingly, but never punish a Player for having a high Modifier. If it is likely their character would be able to easily succeed on something, allow it rather than changing the Difficulty on the spot. Fate Cards \u00b6 Players start with 2 Jokers as Fate Cards and will randomly gain more as they draw their Aces. As the GM, you also reserve Fate Cards when controlling Dealers during a session. Fate Cards are opportunities for Players and Dealers to manipulate fate by allowing for a re-draw or avoiding damage. You can ask if a Player would like to use a Fate Card when they Miss or when they take damage. You can encourage Players to use these more often by giving additional Fate Cards to reward key moments of play. This can be a great tool for encouraging great roleplay or working together. Skills Breakdown \u00b6 Players will want to make Checks based on their characters' strengths. Their approach to a situation should determine the nature of a Check. As the GM, you have the final say as to which Skill applies. Attributes are meant to be more responsive/reactive, and are often used for Contested Checks. Skills are intended to be more active for character-initiated events. The list below provides of general information about the Attributes and Skills (see Full Player's Guide for more info). AGL Agility: Dodging Contested Checks, boosts Unarmored AC. Finesse: Performing difficult physical actions with ease. Primary Skill for Martial role. Stealth: Moving quietly, undetected. CON Conviction: Strength of character to resist harmful mental effects. Bluffing: Convincing others, either truthfully or deceptively. Performance: Acting under scrutiny, potentially in front of audiences. GUT Intuition: Gut feelings about the state of the world (e.g., truthfulness, supernatural knowledge) Detection: Observing the world using all senses. Craft: Practicing a honed trade (i.e., Medicine, Pottery, Piety). Primary Skill for Support role. INT Intelligence: Reactive critical thinking or recalling recalling explicit information. Knowledge: Recalling and amassing knowledge at leisure. Primary Skill for Casters. Investigation: Seeking the answer to a question or piecing together information. STR Strength: Physical limits and boundaries (e.g,. resisting a push). Athletics: Exerting oneself in physical sustained challenge. Brute: Burst force or single lifts. Primary Skill for Defenders. VIT Vitality: Resisting bodily harm. Determines max HP. Contested Checks \u00b6 Contested Checks are initiated when two characters attempt to accomplish opposite goals, or one character attempts to overcome the resistance of another (see Full Player Guide for more info). The list below features a few examples of Contested Checks, but, as the GM, it's up to you to decide what a situation calls for if it is not explicitly described in the guide or in a Power mechanic. Tackle Target: Initiator Finesse vs. Target Athletics Convince Target, truthfully or deceptively: Initiator Bluffing vs. Target Detection or (if posessing relevant knowledge) Knowledge Sneaking past Target: Initiator Stealth vs. Target Detection Arm wrestle: Brute vs. Brute Impersonation: Initiator Performance vs. Target Detection or (if suspecting) Ingestigation Epic Events \u00b6 Epic Events are unique, time-gated scenarios that can occur throughout an Adventure. As the Game Master (GM), you determine when an Epic Event will happen, set the Difficulty, and decide the stakes. Epic Events invoke a specific set of rules for determining the outcome, which is different than traditional combat, social interaction, or exploration. These are typically very draining on Player stamina (remaining decks), and could be a tool to engage resource management. This is also is a good way to engage all Players in faster-paced, more free-form roleplaying. Since Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue, planning, and participation from every Player. As the GM, you are actively drawing against the Players on a TC during the Epic Event. The odds are skewed in the Players' favor by allowing them to draw using Skill Modifiers while you draw with a +0 Mod. Your ability to modify the challenge of an Epic Event comes from setting the Difficulty. For more information on Epic Events, visit the Full Player's Guide How to Identify an Epic Event \u00b6 Epic Events often occur within a limited time frame, typically less than a minute, and typically no more than twice per session. This could be a fleeing event under some thread of harm (e.g., a crumbling dungeon or an erupting volcano), or an unexpected smaller scenario (e.g., preventing an uncontrolled vehicle from crashing). It can cover a small scope (e.g, a moment of surprise that begins a larger battlefield), something larger (e.g., replace an entire combat), or even be used to shrink longer periods of time into manageable pieces (e.g., dealing with the storms and resource management of travel across a sea). As GM, you will get a feel for what makes for a good Epic Event, and how to place it in your narrative to keep the session feeling fresh and lively for all of your Players. Setting an Epic Event's Difficulty \u00b6 The GM sets the difficulty ahead by announcing how many Successes will be needed before 3 Failures. Setting a difficulty of 4 means that the Players need to make 4 successful Checks before reaching 3 failures. Deciding the Stakes \u00b6 Going into an Epic Event, there is no guarantee of Success, even at lower Difficulties. Try to balance the outcomes based on the scope of the Epic Event. Not all Epic Events are life-or-death scenarios, and consequences can vary depending on the number of success before 3 failures. If Players get 3 Failures trying to escape a collapsing dungeon, they may take a little damage, discard some cards, or lose a precious object in the fray. Likewise, if the Players are successful without any failures, the reward for their success can be balanced accordingly. An Example of an Epic Event \u00b6 The Players hear screaming ~ 100 ft away, and rush to investigate. They see a group of townsfolk being attacked by a group of monsters. Each of the townsfolk is engaged with a different monster. The difficulty is set to 3, and 5 target cards are drawn. The Players then declare which skill they will use to save one of the townsfolk, and must make a suited hit before the GM does to succeed on each TC. The Defender chooses Brute, and intends to ram into a monster while the townsperson gets away. The GM decides a corresponding DR of 3 on a 9 of Hearts Target Card (TC). The Defender draws a 6 of Hearts and, with the Defender's +2 to Brute, this is a Suited Success and a success on the first Epic Event challenge. The Support wants to protect a townsperson using their magic via Craft, with a +1 modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, with a DR 2 on a 7 of Clubs TC. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then draws, without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades; also a miss. Support and GM each take turns drawing until until the Support draws a 5 of Clubs, which is a success. The Martial wants to sneak up to a monster and help the townsperson escape, using Stealth. The GM sets a DR 2 on the Jack of Spades TC. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of Spades. As the GM got a Suited Success, this is the first failure for the Players. The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first, missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses a Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for the Players, which ends the Epic Event. The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the townsfolk. Due to the one failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated. The Players can choose to follow after the monsters or regroup with the townsfolk they saved. This might result in a reward from the local government for saving lives, or kick off a new Adventure that involves seeking out the monsters. Combat \u00b6 Deck of Adventures (DofA) combat is meant to be fast-paced, collaborative, and accessible. It is designed around a simple core, while allowing for a lot of player freedom based on how they built their character. To run combat in DofA successfully, you should plan encounters thoughtfully and be able to adapt on the fly when Players make unexpected strategic decisions. Some sessions may be very focused on combat, with 3-4 combat encounters between Full Rests, while others will be more roleplay-oriented. As the Game Master (GM), you decide what mix is best for your table. Some Players may be more interested in combat, while others get excited and engaged with good social roleplay, and it is up to you as the GM to balance the interests of the Players at the table. Initiating Combat \u00b6 You choose when to declare the beginning of Combat, and this triggers the start of Combat Turn Order. The start depends entirely on the scenario. It might begin when the Players decide to attack an enemy, or when an enemy decides to attack the Players. To determine Turn Order, every Player will draw a Target Card for themselves. As the GM, you will draw a TC for each Minion and Dealer involved in the Encounter, including any new enemies that appear throughout Combat. To simplify, a group of Minions might have a single TC, but a Dealer must always have their own TC. Strengths and Weaknesses \u00b6 There are ways to build encounters that allow the Players to highlight their character's strengths or Vulnerabilities. If a Player recently took a new Power, you might build an encounter to give them a chance to shine. A new area of effect Power would be feel great to deploy on a swarm of smaller enemies. If a Player has the Wanted Vulnerability, you might introduce the faction hunting them, who might approach the Players as hostile. Can the Players talk their way out of the situation, or will they choose to fight? Setting up Combat Encounters \u00b6 You decide what types of Combat Encounters you want to run during a session. Players could be matched against a single strong foe. Many smaller enemies might have the players torn in different directions. A single Dealer with supporting Minions might have interesting interaction effects, where one gains benefits in the presence of the other. GMs should try to include a mix of roleplay and combat in an Adventure, when possible. Storming an enemy fortress may result in several Combat Encounters back to back. Investigating a crime in a major city may have more social investigation-based with relatively little combat. Moving in space \u00b6 Deck of Adventures is designed to be playable using either imperial or metric units, on either a square grid or hex map. For units, treat 1 space as either 5 feet or 1 meter. You choice of map can impact diagonal movement and area of effect. Following the Player Guide , moving diagonally on a grid is assumed to be the same as moving horizontally. You could alternatively decide that players are limited to 2 diagonal moves per round of combat, or that a diagonal move is worth 1.5 speed. To measure area of effect (AOE), refer to the images provided in Visual Tools . Powers will define an AOE by it's shape and size (e.g., Cone 3). Here, we us N to define each shape at any size. Line : Pick an edge of the space of the character or object causing this effect. Draw a straight line perpendicular to this edge N spaces long. Any space touched by this line is affected. Aura : Unless otherwise specified, the point of origin is assumed to be the character or object causing the effect. A circle is drawn around this point. Any space caught overlapping with this circle is affected. On a grid map, the radius of this circle is at the far edge of the Nth space away from the point of origin. On a hex map, the radius of this circle is at the far edge of the line segment pointing in the direction of the point of origin. Cone : Pick an edge of the space of the character or object causing this effect. The radius is measured from the center point of this edge, with additional lines drawn to endpoints of the arc. Any space caught overlapping with this arc is affected. On a grid map, the radius extends N squares away from the origin, with lines drawn to the corners of the squares included in a perpendicular line N squares long. On a hex map, the radius extends N minus .5 hex away from this origin, with lines drawn to the far-most corners of the hex touched by a straight line N hex long, perpendicular to the radius. Character Types \u00b6 Minions are enemies that are weaker than the Players. They often have lower HP, and cannot take Powers or Vulnerabilities. They do not have access to Fate Cards, and draw from a single GM deck. Dealers are just as powerful as, or more powerful than, the Players. They have a name, and experience that would lend them power. GMs might draw from a separate deck of cards for each Dealer. Each starts with one Fate Card, and reserves Aces when drawn. Dealers can also take Powers and Vulnerabilities, and may possess items. See below for how to turn a Dealer into a Boss. Bystanders are allied or neutral characters that exist throughout the world, as anything from a store owner to noble ambassador. These characters are typically on par in power with Minions, and may be persuaded to join Players in combat as Companions or GM controlled Dealers. Companions are Player-controlled creatures who can be commanded with an Action. Players can invest in Powers to make their Companion more powerful. A GM might also grant a temporary Companion as part of an Adventure, potentially as a result of a Check, or an exchange for other money or items. Bosses are even more powerful than Dealers, and gain the following benefits: Adversary Actions, House Actions, and Phases. Creating a Boss Encounter \u00b6 Boss Encounters are best saved for the end of Adventures, as a culmination of the the story thus far. As the GM, you choose what Actions they have access to. Adversary Actions \u00b6 An Adversary Action is a Boss ability that takes place outside their turn during Combat to help balance encounters where a single Boss might be facing up to 6 Players. This helps Players feel a sense of danger from a single enemy. Adversary Actions may be related to resource replenishment, like allowing a Boss to recover a small amount of HP or gain Power Points. They may allow for an additional attack, or an environmental effect involving a Check for the Players. Players who fail might take damage or receive a Status Condition like Entangled. For example, a poisonous monster would have the following Adversary Action: Acid Splash . A cloud of acid appears in a 4 space cube. Any creature inside the cube at the start of their turn makes a DR 3 Agility Check or take 2 damage. On a success, 1 damage. House Actions \u00b6 House Actions take place when a Boss is in their home or base of operations. Once initiated, they happen at the beginning of every round of combat. This is a great way to add in dynamic elements to an encounter, such as new enemies appearing or the environment becoming more dangerous. Boss Phases \u00b6 Dealers often have < 10 HP. For balance, Boss Encounters can have multiple Phases. After running out of HP, they replenish and changes their approach. Every time a Boss enters a new Phase, draw a new TC for them. The following list features a number of examples that might be triggered by a new Phase: Boss escapes to another location Boss summons Minions Boss alters the environment to make certain areas cause damage (e.g., erupting flame) require a check (e.g,. Agility check to stay standing on ice) Boss disappears, and reappears when Minions have been defeated after a set number of rounds after an environmental effect dissipates Boss changes features like core stats higher or lower AR drawing with Upper Hand (e.g., putting in more effort) drawing with Lower Hand (e.g., getting angry/sloppy) Example Combat Encounter designed for 4 Players at Level 2 \u00b6 In a longer campaign, mix up the types of encounters to see how Players react and interact with each other. This will keep things fresh so combat keeps Players engaged over time. Here, the context is kept purposefully blank to fill in with your setting. Location. Start with a wide open space for the Players and enemies to move around in, between 10-20 spaces across to allow for movement and let the range influence Player tactics. Setup. Add 4 Minions close to the entrance and 1 Dealer farther away. 2 Minions are melee guards and 2 are shooters 3-5 spaces away, to force the Players to choose their targets and allow space between each enemy. The Players will need to deal with the Minions first in order to reach the Dealer, allowing the Dealer to use their abilities in the first 2+ rounds. Stat Blocks \u00b6 Every creature has a set of statistics that govern their actions in the game. Consult their stat block to learn their strengths and weaknesses, and what actions they can take in combat. If you want to make your own custom creature, you can use the sample template provided below: Name \u00b6 HP: X AR: X PP: X Skill Mods: \u00b1X AGL, \u00b1X CON, \u00b1X GUT, \u00b1X INT, \u00b1X STR, \u00b1X VIT Passives: Passive : Descrip Passive : Descrip Vulnys: Vulny : Descrip Actions: Major: Attack : \u00b1X hit, X damage, X range, (single/X multi)-target, (AGL, etc, No) Save (, X on save) Minor: Trait : Descrip Adversary: Trait : Descrip Dealer: Captain \u00b6 HP : 5 AR : 2 PP : 2 Skill Mods : AGL +2, STR +2, VIT +2 Passives : Multiattack : the Dealer can make two attacks on its turn. Lucky : on a suited miss the Dealer can make one free redraw. Vulnys : Eye for an Eye, if you attack in combat, you must target the enemy who hit you most recently. Actions : Major : Attack, Melee : +2 to hit, 1 damage, 1 range, single target. Attack, Ranged : +1 to hit, 1 damage, 10 range, single target. Minor : Speed Boost : double the Dealer's movement. Adversary : Break Stun : when the Dealer is stunned, they can end the stun. This can only be done once per round. Command Minions : the Dealer commands one Minion it can see to attack. The targeted Minion can move up to 3 spaces and take one Major Action. Minions 1 + 2: Melee Guards \u00b6 HP : 2 AP : 1 AR : 2 Skill Mods : AGL +1, STR +1, VIT +1 Actions : Major : Attack, Melee : +1 to hit, 1 damage, 1 range, single target. Minor : Reinforce Armor : adds 1 AP (up to a maximum of 1). Minions 3 + 4: Ranged Shooters \u00b6 HP : 2 AR : 3 Skill Mods : AGL +1, GUT +1, INT +1 Actions : Major : Attack, Ranged : +1 to hit, 1 damage, 10 range, single target. Minor : Ready Aim : focuses attention on a single target. While that target is in range, draw attacks with the Upper Hand. Items \u00b6 Standard Currency \u00b6 Every setting may have its own currency and economy, but in Deck of Adventures the standard recommendation is to use a system based on rare metals. Gold, Silver, and Copper Pieces are useful breakdowns, and can be modified as needed to fit your setting. By default, currencies are at a 1:10 ratio with the next-most valuable counterpart: 1 Gold Piece (gp) = 10 Silver Pieces (sp), and 1 Silver Piece = 10 Copper Pieces (cp). When creating your own currency, use the below tables as a reference for adapting these items to your setting. The GM can grant currency as a reward for completing an Adventure, defeating an Encounter, and general exploration and adventuring. You can show your Players the tables below, or encourage them to seek out merchants to acquire new items using the currency they've earned. Leverage the Player's desire to continue to strengthen their character by offering them opportunities to earn more currency during their Adventures, and reward strong roleplay, barter skills, and careful exploration and examination with additional currency. Starting Items \u00b6 All characters start with a basic set of items, depending on choices made at Character Creation. This may be setting dependent. A high fantasy campaign may start characters with a Magic Item, while others may simply start the characters with a Standard Weapon and Light Armor. Determine what makes the most sense for your world. The general starting items in Deck of Adventures include a standard weapon, simple armor, an Adventuring Pack, a Trinket and 50 gp. Adventuring Pack contains the following: - 1 Bedroll - 1 Rations Kit (contains 10 meals) - 5 Torches - 1 Flint & Tinder - 1 Flask Trinkets are simple items, low in monetary value, that are meaninful to the character and may be a part of their backstory. Examples include: - a small statue - a bauble from childhood - a broken dagger - a worn painting or image - an old letter Work with your Players during Character Creation to generate a list of Starting Items that make sense for their character. Take their Vulnerabilities into account as well. Would an Outsider carry something significant to their people? Maybe a character with the Frail Vulnerability would carry a cane with them of some significance. Weapons \u00b6 Weapons are one way to damage in combat. The quality of that weapon determines how much damage. Weapon Quality Table Damage Descriptor Average Cost 1 Standard 5 gp 2 Improved 500 gp 3 Heroic 2,500 gp 4 Legendary 5,000 gp Characters with high quality weapons are able to deal damage quickly, so keep this in mind when balancing Encounters or granting Players loot as they Level Up. The average costs are meant to guide you as to when Players can expect to afford each, but these can be given as rewards or made available at any price. Armor \u00b6 Armor and Agility Modifiers are the only way for characters to alter their base Armor Range (AR). For characters with low Agility, wearing Armor will help them avoid attacks in combat. Base AR for an unarmored character is 3. Wearing Armor reduces this AR depending on Type. Some have Strength Requirements in order to wear. A character who ignores this requirment may only use their movement speed and must make all Agility, Finesse, and Stealth Checks at Lower Hand. Armor Type Table AR Armor Type AP Prerequisite Average Cost 3 Unarmored 0 - - 3 Light 0 - 5 gp 2 Medium 0 - 25 gp 2 Fortified 1 Strength \u2265 0 100 gp 1 Heavy 2 Strength \u2265 1 500 gp 1 Massive 3 Strength \u2265 2 1500 gp 1 Gleaming 2 Agility \u2265 3 1500 gp Characters may start with Light Armor at Level 1, but must acquire other armor over the course of their Adventures, either through purchase or reward. Some armor and items also grant Armor Points (AP). Items like Shields can provide AP when readied using an Action, while other types of Armor may have magical effects that provide AP (see Magic Items ). Shields can be purchased and can be found in varying quality. Shield Quality Table AP Descriptor Average Cost 1 Standard 5 gp 2 Hardened 200 gp 3 Impervious 1,500 gp General Items \u00b6 When Players venture into a town or city, they will expect to find a store available that will sell them General Goods. The items they find here are up to the GM's discretion, but below is a list of items and their general costs. General Items Table Item Name Cost Hammer 5 sp Backpack 8 sp Empty Vial 2 sp Canvas Pouch 2 sp Tent 1 gp Torches 5 sp Flint & Tinder 5 sp Bedroll 8 sp Rations Kit 5 sp Flask 1 gp Lantern 2 gp Mirror 1 gp Crowbar 1 gp Tools \u00b6 Tools are useful items that a character can use to perform certain Checks more easily. A character who uses a Tool to perform a Check may draw with the Upper Hand. General domains and trade skills will use a specific tool to make a Check. These are listed below. Tools Table Various professions in the world require tools for their craft. To attempt a Check in a relevant profession, you must be in possession of that profession's tools or you make your Check at the Lower Hand. These tools can often be found in a General Store, though in some settings some professions' tools may be harder to find. Profession Name Cost Blacksmith 5 gp Locksmith 5 gp Chef 3 gp Carpenter 3 gp Sailor 2 gp Leatherworker 5 gp Clothier 5 gp Navigator 1 gp Alchemist 3 gp Herbalist 1 gp Mountaineer 3 gp Jeweler 10 gp Cartographer 5 gp Consumables \u00b6 Consumables are one-time use items that grant a specific effect, usually during a set duration of time. These can include Potions, Charms, Meals, and Ammunition. See below for how to use these Consumables in game. Consumable Type Use Time General Properties Potions Minor Action Short term effects, usually a single effect. Charms Major Action Medium-term effects, more complex effects. Meals 10 minutes Long-term effects, enough to last most of a day. These items may vary in supply and cost depending on where the Players are looking. In a desolate town that only has a trader pass through once every year, these items might be in short supply. In a wealthy merchant district of a major city, they would be easy to find. It is up to the GM which Consumables to make available, and when. The reason to grant access to Consumables over Magical Items is to allow the Players to feel like they've gotten something valuable and powerful, but they need to be strategic in when to use it. These can create memorable moments of an Adventure without permenantly altering the balance of power. The Consumables listed below draw from a selection of possible Consumables and their Effects that you can add to your game. Feel free to create your own Consumables and ask the Community for help as needed. Consumable Name Cost Effect Duration Potion of Healing 5 gp Regain 1 HP immediately Potion of Strength 15 gp Gain +1 to all Strength-based Checks 1 min Potion of Agility 15 gp Gain +1 to all Agility-based Checks 1 min Potion of Conviction 15 gp Gain +1 to all Conviction-based Checks 1 min Potion of Intelligence 15 gp Gain +1 to all Intelligence-based Checks 1 min Potion of Intuition 15 gp Gain +1 to all Intuition-based Checks 1 min Potion of Vitality 25 gp Gain +1 Maximum HP and +1 to all Vitality-based Checks 1 min Charm of Efficiency 65 gp You cannot draw with Upper or Lower Hand 1 hour Charm of True Aim 40 gp All Attacks are made with Upper Hand 1 hour Charm of Amplification 55 gp All Upper Hand and Lower Hand effects are doubled 1 hour Charm of Wounding 30 gp When dealing damage with an Attack or Power, add +1 damage to the total 1 hour Hearty Stew 10 gp Gain +1 HP and +1 to your Maximum HP 8 hours Focusing Beverage 10 gp Gain +1 HP and +1 to your Maximum PP 8 hours Fortifying Feast 10 gp Gain +3 AP immediately. For the duration, if you end your turn with 0 AP, return to 1 AP 8 hours Magic Items \u00b6 Some items can have additional effects granted while wielding them, such as modifying damage on a Suited Hit or granting additional effects on a Major Success. Upgrading Items \u00b6 Some items can be upgraded with the proper materials. A Standard Weapon or Light Armor can be modified to higher quality levels, and they can also be outfitted with magical upgrade materials as well. These materials are an optional addition to any GM's setting, and they are very straightforward ways to reward your Players during an Adventure with clear upgrades to existing items so they don't have to replace items often. For example, a gemstone attached a weapon causes an additional 1 damage. Attached to armor, the same gemstone might grants +1 Max PP or HP.","title":"GM Guide"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#gms-guide-to-deck-of-adventures","text":"","title":"GM\u2019s Guide to Deck of Adventures"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#introduction","text":"As the Game Master (GM), your task is to bring together a group of Players and guide them through an Adventure.

You are both the arbiter of the rules, and the actor/playwright who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the majority of the characters who populate the world. You control when certain characters come and go, scene changes, and the narration between scenes. You build the world, populate it with characters and history, and then the Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand. GMs are responsible for preparing ahead of sessions and guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative Adventure. You bring the game to life with any type of story you can imagine. There are so many possibilities as Game Master, and this guide is intended to help GMs develop and hone their skills running Adventures. There are many different approaches GMs take to this role, focusing on their unique strengths and talents. Don't compare yourself to others, especially those with years of experience. This craft takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great GM within your first few sessions by following some of the advice in this guide. The DofA Community also is available to respond to questions and offer advice, drawing from years of collective experience. You should be an impartial force in the world, controlling both allies and enemies neutrally. The best sessions feel like everyone is working together to complete an objective, even the GM, rather than competition between Players and GM. This is a delicate balance, and GMs should ask for Players' feedback. It's also a GM's responsibility to provide feedback to the Players at the table when necessary, especially if one's play style may be a distraction to others at the table.","title":"Getting Started as a Game Master"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#making-checks","text":"As the GM, you decide when characters should make a Check when attempting an action during an Adventure. Some actions just happen, like a character opening an unlocked door. Other actions might require the character to attempt a Skill Check to see if they are successful. Incorporating luck makes Adventures feel more dynamic and exciting. When characters make a Check, they are drawing from their expertise (or inexperience) with a specific Skill to see how they perform. Their Modifier (Mod) indicates their character's expertise with a specific Skill. Characters with high Strength would be more likely to succeed on an Athletics Check than Characters with low Strength, though by incorporating luck a low Strength character still has a chance to succeed on a Strength Check. You determine when a Check should be made, what Skill should be used, and set the Difficulty. A Player might ask if a specific Skill could be used instead, and it is your decision whether to allow it in the circumstance. Stepping over a crack in the floor should not require a Check, but leaping ten feet across a chasm would. Attempting to sneak past a sleeping guard still requires a Stealth Check, but it should be less difficult than sneaking past the same guard who is on high alert. Flow state is achieved when we are at the peak of our ability and met with the exact level of challenge to fit our skills. To keep Players engaged, dial in the difficulty to where they're feeling challenged in a way that suits their play style, without worrying about what resources they have left.","title":"Making Checks"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#gm-preparation","text":"As a GM, you will need to spend time outside of normal session hours working on your Adventure. You will be the primary resource for information about the world. Players will ask questions, and it's up to you to provide details, even if it's improvised. It's also OK to say you don't know something, or that you'll need to get back to them after the session. You should be open to Player questions and ideas, and work with them to tell the story as much as possible. Improvisation and spontaneity are two vital ingredients to a great session, but having key moments mapped out is important to shaping the Players' experience. What you prepare may not pan out perfectly, and that's part of the fun. The Players bring their own creative agency to the table, and that can be unpredictable. It's important not to force the Players back into a prescribed narrative. If the Players logically lead the the session in a different direction, go with it. The Players also may not know when story beats are improvised, and these moments can make for the most organic and memorable Adventures. During a session, GMs keep some information hidden from the Players. This can be a physical or virtual GM screen that separates the information that's available to the GM and not the players. Behind the GM screen also serves as a metaphor for what players can and can't see. As the GM, you choose what to share and under what circumstances, as a result of a Check or just part of the narrative. Every GM has their own style of maintaining this division of what is hidden and what is revealed.","title":"GM Preparation"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#being-a-deck-of-adventures-game-master","text":"As a Deck of Adventures (DofA) Game Master (GM) you are controlling the flow of card draws on both sides of the table.

More decks may be useful to represent different groups in combat. If you only have one deck available, split it into two 26-card decks and shuffle regularly. One deck of cards should be designated the Minion Deck and one designated the World Deck . Different color card backs will help distinguish the two throughout play. The Minion Deck is used during combat and when applying negative Status Conditions . The World Deck is used to draw Target Cards for NPCs, make social checks, and used for drawing a card based on a table out of combat. Before each Combat, reshuffle the Minion Deck. You reshuffle the World Deck when it is empty. Most NPCs won't stick around long enough to use a deck completely, and therefore won't shuffle prematurely, which would invoke Lower Hand on Checks. For the exceptional NPC, such as a Dealer or a Boss, try assigning them a deck, if available. If unavailable, you can decide when to invoke Lower Hand behind the GM screen.","title":"Game Master Resources"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#managing-player-resources","text":"Adventures can also be designed to test different aspects of the Players and characters. Each Player holds a single deck of 52 cards, with two Fate Cards reserved at the beginning of play. Each character has statistics that include total Health Points (HP), Power Points (PP), and Armor Points (AP). Your focus during a session will be balancing the expenditure of all of these resources. Absolute values are low in Deck of Adventures to promote speed of play and simplicity of calculations. With that in mind, Player controlled Dealer HP starts at 5, but scales with level and Vitality modifier. The theoretical maximum is 21 HP, at level 10 with a +6 Vitality modifier. Armor Points are similarly small, with a maximum of 3. Maximum Power Points may be larger at higher levels of play, the enemies that players face should require higher level Powers that balance out this scaling.

They then make all checks at Lower Hand until they complete a Rest. At lower levels, Players may not reach the end of their decks between Rests to incur Lower Hand penalties. As Players level up, both the Powers they use and the Encounters they face may require more draws, bringing them closer to running out. Some Players will go through cards more quickly than others. Keep this in mind when developing Encounters to challenge different Players.","title":"Cards"},{"location":"1_Mechanics/02_GMGuide/#resting","text":"Health and Power Points are also balanced by Rests.

While Resting, the Players will regain their HP and PP, and expending Rest Cards. Keep these resources in mind when planning Encounters that deal damage. Try to keep Players motivated to press on, even without full resources. To Rest, Players will consult with the GM about whether it may be feasible to secure an uninterrupted break. Players can only use Rest Cards after a Rest has been successfully completed. If a situation is tense, it may not always be possible to gain the benefits of a Rest. In the event that a Rest is interrupted, it can be resumed based on the remaining time left and extended as necessary. For example, a Full Rest would be easy to secure at a comfortable inn in a major city. A temporary hiding spot in an enemy bandit camp would me much more risky. You could use (a) a Player Stealth Check (b) an enemy Detection Check, or (c) an Epic Event to see if the Rest is interrupted.

For Player Vulnerabilities with more severe mechanical consequences, or those that could lead to dangerous situations, GMs should avoid planning too much around this weakness. The Players should feel like their Vulnerabilities add to the richness of the story, and that are ultimately rewarded for taking on the added challenge. A Vulnerability should feel both like an added difficulty and the source of heroism despite the odds. At its best, Vulnerabilities will inspire characters that develop over time, intertwining with a broader narrative. For NPCs, Vulnerabilities can add depth to an otherwise flat archetype of merchant or farmer. Are there Vulnerabilities that can work to challenge the values of Players? What foils can help Players flesh out their character by disagreeing with another character. Seeing a corruptible guard might really activate a character focused on justice. Enemy NPC Vulnerabilities also give Players something to exploit, through deeper analysis of the world. Yes, one Player can do consistent damage by continuing to attack, but another could spend a turn studying movements to learn that their adversary has an injury and can't defend against specific attacks.

When thinking about the Target Card System, it may be helpful to consider a bullseye, where the TC is the center and the DR is the number of circles away from the center you can hit and still be successful. One of the initial barriers a new GM must overcome is helping the Players understand this target system. As Players get more familiar with the system, speed of play increases, and it is then easier for them to understand more complex mechanics. Using the Circular TC-DR Tool is a helpful visual aid. The Target Card System is circular, so an Ace is only 1 away from both a King and a 2. If you were aiming a Check against a Target Card of an Ace, you could consult the below table to understand which cards would be successful within the set DR.

At 2% chance, they should feel amazing for the Player. Make an effort to reward these exact matches whenever possible with additional effects or bonuses. Major Successes happen when the drawn card matches the TC in pip value At 6% chance, this should feel pretty good. In Combat, a Major Success increases the damage of the attack by 1. Out of combat, some smaller bonus should happen whenever possible. Color and Suited Successes happen when the drawn card is within the DR and matches the TC in color or suit.

These are typically very draining on Player stamina (remaining decks), and could be a tool to engage resource management. This is also is a good way to engage all Players in faster-paced, more free-form roleplaying. Since Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue, planning, and participation from every Player. As the GM, you are actively drawing against the Players on a TC during the Epic Event.

The Defender chooses Brute, and intends to ram into a monster while the townsperson gets away. The GM decides a corresponding DR of 3 on a 9 of Hearts Target Card (TC). The Defender draws a 6 of Hearts and, with the Defender's +2 to Brute, this is a Suited Success and a success on the first Epic Event challenge. The Support wants to protect a townsperson using their magic via Craft, with a +1 modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, with a DR 2 on a 7 of Clubs TC. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then draws, without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades; also a miss. Support and GM each take turns drawing until until the Support draws a 5 of Clubs, which is a success. The Martial wants to sneak up to a monster and help the townsperson escape, using Stealth. The GM sets a DR 2 on the Jack of Spades TC. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of Spades. As the GM got a Suited Success, this is the first failure for the Players. The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first, missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses a Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for the Players, which ends the Epic Event. The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the townsfolk. Due to the one failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated.

A Dealer is someone who is in charge of their own fate, and likely plays using their own unique deck. Players are able to level up their Dealers by playing in Adventures, and GMs can set the level of their Dealers to best balance the Encounter during a session. Every Dealer can take Powers and Vulnerabilities, and has Skill Modifiers that impact their ability to interact with the world around them. These are the steps to building a Dealer as part of Character Creation. GMs can find additional advice on how to create a GM Dealer in the GM Guide Decide Your Background \u00b6 First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a 'racial' or species origin (e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport, your character might be more adept at sailing (i.e., certain skill checks) than others. Coming to a new land as an outsider might be a Vulnerability , as described below. Characters beginning their journey at level 1 are relatively unskilled. They may have had one profession for many years, but should not have any significant experience adventuring or traveling beyond the borders of the comfort zone shared by their peers. Choose Your Role \u00b6 Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might apply force, a Caster might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Role grants you access to specific upgrades, called Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must forfeit Powers with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent. Defender Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess with! Primary Skill: Brute Suggested Suit: Clubs \u2663\ufe0f / Defense \ud83d\udee1 Support Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the support of our friends. Primary Skill: Craft Suggested Suit: Hearts \u2665\ufe0f / Life \u2764\ufe0f\u200d Martial Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons to directly damage enemies. Agile and light on their feet! Primary Skill: Finesse Suggested Suit: Spades \u2660\ufe0f / Offense \ud83e\udd1b Caster Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techno-wizards of a much more mundane world. Their intellect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely comprehend. Primary Skill: Knowledge Suggested Suit: Diamonds \u2666\ufe0f / Conjuring \u26a1\ufe0f Using Experience Points (XP) \u00b6 Both at character creation (6) and at the GM's discretion for each level up (3), you are awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an Attribute, a Skill, or remove a Vulnerability. Total XP is equal to 6 + (level * 3). GM permitting, you may respec, or exchange powers for their equivalent XP value. Choose Your Powers \u00b6 Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield, covering simple abilities like swinging a weapon to complicated magical feats. Some Powers require a specific Role, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill Modifiers. Each Power has an associated XP cost. Passive mechanics, or Minor magical tricks typically cost 1 XP. Big, character-altering feats will cost more. Major Powers are tiresome and require a limited resource to use: Power Points (PP). Each Power will list the range of PP that can be spent (e.g., 1 PP to target one enemy vs. 2 PP to target multiple). The more PP spent, the bigger the effect. Numbers separated by or in the mechanics description indicate different effects depending on PP spent. Adding a Power with an PP cost raises the character's maximum PP by the largest number of PP listed for that Power. PP are replenished on a Rest . Unless otherwise noted, Powers... 1. Take a Major Action to perform and use a Dealer's Primary Skill Modifier. 2. That have sustained effects, may only be used one at a time. Passive Powers take no action and are always in effect. 3. That damage, deal 1 point of damage. 4. That have implied range, may be used up to 6 spaces away. Choose Your Vulnerabilities \u00b6 People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship with the world. At character creation you can choose up to four Vulnerabilities, which add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim. Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 (Minor) or 2 (Major) Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability. Vulnerability types: Minor : Adds 1 XP Major : Adds 2 XP Some Vulnerabilities are either Minor or Major, depending on the effects you choose. Changing Attributes and Skills \u00b6 All Attributes and Skills start at a 0 Modifier. You can adjust your Skills and Attributes using your Experience Points (XP), which will help define how capable your character for relevant actions. On initial character creation, you can spend or earn points by increasing or decreasing Attributes and Skill Modifiers up to -2 or +2. This upper limit increases as you level up (see table below).

Every Dealer can take Powers and Vulnerabilities, and has Skill Modifiers that impact their ability to interact with the world around them.

Growing up at a seaport, your character might be more adept at sailing (i.e., certain skill checks) than others. Coming to a new land as an outsider might be a Vulnerability , as described below.

Terms that are for flavor, not mechanics, are Italicized Core Design Principles \u00b6 Deck of Adventures is, first and foremost, designed for accessibility , both in ease of on-boarding and ease of access. Not everyone has specialty dice or the time to study complex interconnected rules released over a long history. While becoming a Game Master (GM) may take some time and dedication, a player completely new to tabletop roleplaying should be able to pick up Deck of Adventures and start playing within an hour. This means mechanics should be easy to learn, and easy to explain during a first session. One only needs a standard deck of playing cards. Second, Deck of Adventures is designed to be flexible , across the many types of stories GMs want to tell. While our mechanics have been workshopped with lore from the World of Erdania, all core mechanics should be portable to another setting. In other words, Deck of Adventures is setting-agnostic. No core mechanic should imply a specific setting (e.g., magical fantasy) and all settings should be playable by ignoring or reflavoring a subset of optional mechanics (e.g., the Mystic Aura is EMP tech). Third, participants should be able to quickly and easily engage in rich storytelling with only a standard deck of playing cards. Any component that doesn't contribute to this end should be revisited. Accessible and flexible doesn't, however, mean sparse. A first-time player can pick up a pre-made character in minutes, but then optionally spend much longer planning out how to make a bespoke character that speaks to them, with creativity fueled by the wide array of choices. Design Axioms \u00b6 Though itterative design, developers have landed on the following as touchstones. Pip value is contextual. The number on the card has no inherent value. There's nothing good or bad about a 2 or a King , a Spade or a Club . The randomized context determines how good the outcome is. PP = HP = AP. During rests, players decide which of these reources to replenish. Characters may have different maximum, but expending one should feel roughly equivalent to the others. Target Cards remain on a character at all times. Each character is always represented by a Target Card. Between combats, the TC remains active on a character for any other Checks. A new TC is drawn at the start of the next combat to shuffle the turn order around for each combat. Target Cards changing often is important. When Player Dealers are drawing cards constantly aiming at a specific TC, the likelihood of a success decreases as more cards that hit are drawn from the deck. Changing TCs to represent each enemy or challenge keeps the odds of drawing a success balanced over the course of an Adventure.","title":"Design"},{"location":"2_Development/02_Design_Document/#design-document","text":"","title":"Design Document"},{"location":"2_Development/02_Design_Document/#drafting-specifics","text":"The following are not permitted in filenames: () {} [] !@#$%^&* ' ` and spaces.
