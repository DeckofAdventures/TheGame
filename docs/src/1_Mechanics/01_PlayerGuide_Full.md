# Deck of Adventures Full Player's Guide

## What is a Tabletop Game System?

A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are
used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game
session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage
for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM
presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the
game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player’s success and failure, and
guides the group in a meaningful way.

Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when
starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things.
Common game systems range from high fantasy to space-faring, typically using many-sided dice;
rules, supplements, and other materials for various TTRPG game systems can
be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself
apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards.
While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action,
Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck.

## Guiding Principles

In times of uncertainty, defer to the following:

1. Have fun.
2. The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to ensure the
entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and will work
to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up.

## The Action Deck

Deck of Adventures is based around a 54-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A)
across 4 suits, as well as Jokers. Each player should have their own Deck, with room
for a Discard Pile and Fate Card pile.

1. Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a Check, which means
  drawing from their respective decks to inform the outcome.

2. Jokers and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, for both players
  and the GM. All other cards go directly into a Discard Pile.

3. Players will use their deck to do most anything; it represents their character's
  stamina until they complete a Rest. When the Action Deck is empty and a player has to
  shuffle between rests, they suffer from one level of
  [Fatigue](./01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#status-conditions) until they complete
  a Full Rest.

## Fate Cards

Fate Cards (Jokers and Aces) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player
to choose when they want a second chance at a key moment.

1. After a Full Rest, both Jokers return to the player's hand as Fate Cards, if they're
not there already.

2. Aces drawn from the deck are played as usual, but remain in the player's hand as a
Fate Card rather than going to the Discard Pile. Aces reserved as Fate Cards are
reshuffled back into the deck after a Full Rest.

3. Any time a player or the GM draws a card, they may discard one held Fate Card and
redraw. Only one redraw is permitted per check.

4. Fate Cards may also be expended to either ...

    1. *Push Fate*: redraw any check.

    2. *Exchange Fate*: gain Power Points equal to the number of Fate Cards used.

    3. *Toughen Up*: ignore damage equal to the number of Fate Cards used. This can be
    done as soon as the damage is applied or before the end of the Player's next turn
    after receiving damage.

5. A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the player's discard pile or signified by
another token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character’s
strengths or weaknesses.

## Characters

### Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers

1. Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and
weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality.

2. Skills are specific to an Attribute. These signify how good a character is at
performing certain types of actions. Each Skill is tied to an Attribute, meaning
improving that Attribute also increases the effectiveness of a related Skill.
Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a Conviction skill. All Attributes and
Skills are listed below and can be viewed on your character sheet.

3. Modifiers reflect a character’s level of expertise in a given Attribute or Skill
domain and allow you to add that number to the Difficulty Range (DR) when making a
Check. These modifiers are determined at Character Creation and can be improved as you
Level Up.

**Complete Attribute and Skill List:**

- Agility AGL
    - Finesse (Fight)
    - Stealth
- Conviction CON
    - Bluffing
    - Performance
   <!-- - Persuasion -->
- Intuition GUT
    - Detection
   <!-- - Faith -->
    - Craft
   <!-- - Naturalism -->
- Intelligence INT
    - Knowledge
    - Investigation
   <!-- - Science -->
- Strength STR
    - Athletics
    - Brute (Fight)
   <!-- - Intimidation -->
- Vitality VIT
   <!-- - Grit -->

Each skill is generally related to a domain of expertise a character may possess. A GM
might call for a Check using a specific Skill, but you can always ask if another
would be applicable in the situation. The GM decides whether the Skill applies, so get
creative!

<!--Add some examples of specific skills being used, with general description of domain -->

### Dealers, NPCs and Companions

The Player Characters (PCs) are typically the heroes of the story. PCs are
considered Dealers and differ from the majority of other characters in the world. The
GM may control other Dealers who can take the form of powerful allies or adversaries
the players may encounter along the way.

1. Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters that are controlled by
the Game Master. They...
    - Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities.
    - Have at least 5 health points (HP).
    - Draw from their own deck of cards.
    - Can receive and use Fate Cards.
    - Can use Discard Actions.

2. NPCs. All other characters. They...
    - Are weaker than Dealers
    - Have limited access to Powers
    - Typically have between 1-3 HP.
    - Draw from a collective set of cards controlled by the GM.
    - Cannot use either Fate Cards or Discard Actions.

3. Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or
other-worldly advisor. A Companion acts on the players turn, draws from the Dealer's
deck of cards, and grants unique features in and out of combat. See the setting
Bestiary for a list of potential Companions and their unique features.

## Playing the Game

### Exploration and Adventuring

The players are creating and experiencing the world at the same time. Adventures can
include exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging in social
interactions with other players and non-playable characters. During an Adventure, the
GM will ask players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier
relevant to the circumstance.

1. **Setting the Scene.** The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events
and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players
are encouraged to ask clarifying questions.

2. **What do I see?** Characters often know more just by having direct access to the
world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a
character might have. The GM’s answer may depend on a successful check.

3. **Talking to the Locals.** The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will
respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks
may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or
other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse
to be rude to one’s fellow players.

### Making a Check

When the GM or a Player calls for a Check, they announce who will be making this check
and reveal (a) a Target Card (TC), (b) the Attribute or Skill associated with the
check. They may also choose to reveal (c) the Difficulty Range (DR).

A Target Card (TC) is like the bullseye on a target you are hoping to hit. The
Difficulty Range (DR) is the range around the TC the player might hope to draw, like
the circles around the bullseye.

The Difficulty Range is decided by the GM and they can choose whether or not to reveal
it before a check is made. Players may consult with their GM to determine if another
Attribute or Skill may be used instead. Once the check is called for and the relevant
skill is selected, players must make the check. A player will draw one or more cards.
Immediately after drawing, a player will apply any relevant Modifiers before reporting
the outcome and whether or not they have successfully fallen within the DR. A Modifier
is added to the DR when a check is made, effectively widening the DR and making it
easier to succeed. A Modifier is indicated on the character sheet next to the relevant
Skill or Attribute related to the Check. Think of it as a character's ability to 'aim' a
check to get closer to the TC.

The GM may describe the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success. This
may be simply to report the success or failure of an action, or provide a more detailed
description of the outcome. The GM may ask the player to describe how their character
successfully accomplishes the action depending on the scenario.

Because the range of cards is circular (Q, K, A, 2, 3, etc.), success is all about
dialing in your effort to match the task at hand as closely as possible. Remembering
which card is 5 below a 3 can be tough, so there is a table below as well as a
[printable tool](./Visual_Tools/README.md) to help look up the DR range as you
get familiar with the system.

**Target Card Range Table**
For each card on the left, refer to the column with the corresponding DR.
Left of 0 is the lower bound, right of 0 is the upper bound.

|**TC**|**-6**|**-5**|**-4**|**-3**|**-2**|**-1**|**0**|**+1**|**+2**|**+3**|**+4**|**+5**|**+6**|
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**A** | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|**2** | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
|**3** | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
|**4** | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
|**5** | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  |
|**6** | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  |
|**7** | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  |
|**8** | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  |
|**9** | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  |
|**10**| 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  |
|**J** | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|**Q** | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|**K** | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | J  | Q  | K  | A  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |

#### Effective Difficulty Range and Negative DRs

Effective Difficulty Range (EDR) is the DR plus Modifier of a
check, which can help players understand the difficultly of a task. A
check can only be attempted if the EDR is -2 or higher. A -1 EDR
requires a Color Major Success, while a -2 EDR requires a Suited Major Success. 
For example, drawing against a King of Diamonds on a -1 EDR means
you must draw a red King to be successful. For a -2 EDR, you need the
King of Diamonds.

During an adventure, there will be tasks of varying degrees of difficulty. As characters
grow, their Modifiers increase and previously challenging tasks 
are made easier. Higher level characters will be faced with more difficult challenges
at a lower DR.
A +6 EDR is an assured success, while
a -3 EDR is assured failure.

#### Degrees of Success

- Exactly matching the TC in numeric value is a Major Success. If the drawn card is a
perfect match (i.e., value and suit), it's a Critical Success. If the card drawn is
within the DR and matches the suit or color (i.e., red/black), it is either a Suited or
Color Success. If there is a suit or color match outside the DR after the modifier has
been applied, this is a Suited or Color Miss. Suit and Color will only matter under
specific circumstances; for certain character Powers, item types or defenses. There is
no critical failure in Deck of Adventures.

**For example**, when Xena attempts to jump across a chasm, the GM reveals a TC of
the 8 of Clubs and a DR of 2, asking for an Athletics check. If the player's Athletics
modifier is +1, the EDR is now 3, and the check is ...

1. A Critical Success if they draw the 8 of Clubs. They might perfectly make the
 jump, impressing their allies, and catch a glimpse of something important in the
 distance.

2. A Major Success if they draw any 8. They might make the jump gracefully enough to
impress their allies without any other benefits.

3. A Success if they draw any card within 3. For TC 8, DR 2, and Mod 1,
this is 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 or J.

4. A Color Success for any Successes that match the color of the TC, in this case black
which would be a Spade.

5. A Suited Success for any Successes that match the Suit of the TC, in this case a
Club. Xena might have a Power that grants benefits to allies on a Suited Success. After
crossing, they can improve their ally's chances of crossing.

6. A Suited or Color Miss if they draw any Club or Spade, respectively below 5 or above
J. Xena might have a Power that lets them redraw on a Suited Miss, for example.

7. A Miss is any Diamond or Heart draw below 5 or above J.

#### Upper and Lower Hand

Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you.

1. Having the Upper Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card
closest to the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A player may choose to stop
drawing before N cards are drawn.

2. Having the Lower Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card that
is furthest from the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. A player must draw all N
cards.

In these cases, all cards drawn are discarded. If N is not specified, draw 1 extra.
Multiple Upper/Lower hand effects can compound or even out. If a rule specifies
Upper/Lower Hand (N+), the effect can apply multiple times. N cards are drawn, +1 for
each instance the effect is applied. For example, running through your deck
without resting results in one level of Fatigue, which causes Lower Hand (1+) on all
Saves. This means that, if another effect causes Lower Hand, 
draw an additional Lower Hand card on
all Saves. 
Upper/Lower Hand effects are cumulative and cancel each other out.

#### Special Checks: Contested Checks and Saves

Certain times during an Adventure, a character may need to respond to the direct actions
of another character. This typically results in one of two special types of Checks:
*Contested Checks* and *Saves*. When the direct will of one character is being imposed
on another, such as one character attempting to grapple another, this is a Contested
Check. When a character attempts to resist or shrug off a negative effect, they make a
Save.

#### Contested Checks

Some checks will be initiated by a character's actions and require others to respond,
pitting two skills against each other. This might be one character sneaking past
another (e.g., Stealth vs. Detection), or one character causing a magical effect that
another tries to dodge (e.g., Craft vs. Agility). This is a Contested Check. In these
cases, the character who initiated the action (i.e., the Attacker) sets the DR; the DR
for a Contested Check is 3 minus half of the Attacker's relevant modifier, to a minimum
of 0. The character(s) responding are the Target(s), and must draw a Check against the
initiator's TC. Rules that describe a
"Contested X Check vs. Y" use the attacker's Skill X and Targets' Y. Targets succeed or
 fail individually.

**For example,** Xena attempts to convince Jonas of something (either truthfully or
with deception), they would use their Bluffing Mod of +2, setting the DR to 2 (3-1).
They draw a TC of 3 of Diamonds, permitting a card between A and 6. Jonas draws an 8 of
Spades with a +1 Modifier to Detection and reports a 7, still outside the DR. Xena would
successfully convince Jonas of something in this scenario.

#### Saves

When a character attempts to resist or shrug off a negative effect, they make a Save.
This could be caused by a Power, Status Condition, or a environmental effect. When a
character makes a Save, they draw a Check against their own TC and apply their relevant
Attribute Modifier. The Attribute and DR are explicitly set by the initiating effect and
cannot be altered. If the effect forcing a Save is a Power, the DR is 3 minus half of
the initiator's relevant Skill Modifier. Saves may still have consequences even on a
success, as specified by the initiating effect.

### In Combat

Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. If
violence is unavoidable, the GM decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of
rules take effect. Combat in Deck of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while
leaving a lot of room for player teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players
should be sure to study their character sheets and know their options ahead of combat,
and use others’ turns to make their choices. Deck of Adventures is all about teamwork,
so communication is encouraged.

GMs may provide a map and other visual cues like character tokens to help players
visualize the situation. On a square grid, moving diagonally counts as one space unless
otherwise ruled by the GM. Unless otherwise specified, each space on the map represents
5 square feet of distance.

In combat, Powers do 1 damage unless otherwise stated. A Major Success does 1 extra
damage. A Critical Success may have an additional effect, at the GM's discretion.

#### Taking Turns

1. Combat order is determined by card draw. At the beginning of combat, all characters
draw a Target Card and place it in on the table in view. The values represent the turn
order (Ace first, then K, Q, etc.) and the TC for any attack. Players with the same
Target Card values as an enemy go first. If two players draw the same Target Card, they
can decide who goes first. Without consensus, the player with the higher Agility
modifier goes first. In the event of a Surprise Round, the characters who are part of
the Surprise Round draw their TCs and take one full round of actions before the
characters being surprised can act.

2. A player may delay their turn in initiative order to intentionally occur before or
after another character(s)', but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their
action(s) by the end of the round. A GM may skip a player’s turn if they are unprepared
and need more time to think, and should ask skipped players to act at the end of the
round before a new one starts.

#### In Combat Actions

Each round represents 6 seconds of game time passing. All of the actions from every
characters' turns unfold simultaneously during this time, even though a turn order is
followed. On a turn, a character may (a) move, (b) perform 1 Major Action, and/or (c)
perform 1 Minor Action in any order they choose. They may also perform any number of
Free Actions, within reason (approx 5), as permitted by the GM.

1. **Movement** By default, character speed is equal to 6, but may be faster or slower.
Speed is the total number of spaces a character can move in a turn. This total may be
split to occur before, after, and/or between actions. A creature can move through a
friendly creature's space as part of their movement but can not end their turn on that
space. A creature cannot move through a hostile creature's space or between two hostile
creatures' spaces if they are within one space of one another.

2. **Actions** The list below are possible Minor/Major Actions, but a GM may permit
others. If an action specifies a skill, this requires a check.

    1. **Free**

        - *Communication* that does not require a check.
        - *Observation*: gaining obvious information about the world.
        - *Toughening Up*: discard one or more Fate Cards to nullify one damage per card
         used.
        - *Exchanging Fate*: discard one or more Fate Cards to gain one Power Point per
        card used.

    2. **Minor**

        - *Object interaction*: Pressing a button, pulling a lever, using a disposable
       item, equipping or changing weapons, etc.
        - *Inspect*: Detection or Investigation vs. GM-determined DR; learn something
         about an opponent or the terrain.
        - *Convince*: Bluffing vs. GM-determined DR; convince a target to change their
         course of action
        - *Recall*: Knowledge vs. GM-determined DR; determine if a character knows a
         specific piece of information

    3. **Major**

        - *Rush*: double movement
        - *Grapple*: Brute vs. target Finesse or Brute; cause one creature to be *Grappled*
        - *Hide*: Stealth vs. target(s) Detection; become *Hidden*

 A character can choose to Ready their Major Action to occur on a stated trigger, such
 as "I will make a Weapon Attack when an enemy moves within 1 space of me." If the
 trigger occurs, the readied Major Action can then be activated. If the trigger does not
 occur before the start of the character's next turn, this Major Action is forfeited,
 along with any Power Points used for the Major Action.

 Some Powers specify multiple options that have different Power Point costs. On using a
 Power, a character must declare the option being used and spend the associated Power
 Point cost. All Power Points used are expended, even on a failure or miss.

#### Ending Combat

When the last enemy combatant has been Knocked Out, retreats, or surrenders, Combat is
over. This ends the turn order, and characters can act independently of turn order.
Characters do not discard their Target Cards after combat ends. This TC represents the
character until the start of the next combat.

If the Players are defeated in combat, the GM determines what happens next in the story.
If the scenario was of life or death importance, the Player Characters may be killed
outright. In less tense scenarios, the Player Characters may simply be left knocked out,
imprisoned, or some other relevant circumstance.

#### Status Conditions

Some Status Conditions will impact a character over time. The duration of each Condition
is listed in the Power or effect that causes it.

  1. **Stunned** If a character is hit by a critical attack, they make a DR 3 CON
  Save at the start of their turn. If failed, they may either move or
  make one Action on their turn, not both. Some Powers can cause the Stunned Condition.

  2. **Entangled** A character may expend a Major Action to make a DR 3 STR Save. Until they
  are successful, their Speed is 0 and any Agility Saves are made with Lower Hand.

  3. **Knocked Down** A character must expend a Minor Action to get up. Their movement speed
  is halved, rounding up. When Knocked Down, attackers within 1 space draw with Upper Hand
  and attackers further than 1 space away draw with Lower Hand.  All STR and AGL Saves are
  made with Lower Hand. A character can use 1 speed to willingly go prone as part of their
  movement, gaining the Knocked Down status.

  4. **Blinded, Deafened** At the start of their turn, as a Free Action, a character makes
  a DR 3 Intuition Save. If they fail, they draw Lower Hand (3) for any action requiring
  the relevant sense.

  5. **Knocked Out** Knocked Out (KO) characters are unable to act until treated by a Craft
  check or a Healing Power (DR 5 vs. the KO character's TC, minus 1 for each turn passed
  since the effect onset). If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, the Player begins
  an Epic Event alone to avoid *Death*.

  6. **Burned** As a Minor Action, a character can make a DR 3 GUT Save to stop the
  burning. On failure, they take 1 damage bypassing AP.

  7. **Poisoned N** Each poisoning effect adds +1 Poisoned. At the start of their turn,
  as a Free Action, a character makes a DR 3 VIT Save to shake off the effects of the
  poison. On failure, they discard N+1 cards.

  8. **Frozen** Movement speed is reduced by half and all STR and AGL based
  skill checks are drawn at Lower Hand. A character makes a DR 3 Strength Save as a Free
  Action at the end of their turn to attempt to end the freeze.

  9. **Suffocating** At the beginning of their turn, a character makes a DR 3 VIT Save.
  On failure, take 2 damage bypassing AP. On a success, take 1 damage.

  10. **Charmed** At the start of their turn or whenever taking damage, a character
  makes a DR 3 GUT Save. On failure, they may not take actions against the interests of
  the creature that caused the condition. Another creature within 6 spaces may use a
  Major action to end this effect. This effect ends automatically if the target is
  damaged by the creature that caused the condition.

  11. **Enthralled** At the start of their turn or whenever taking damage, a character
  makes a DR 3 CON Save. On failure, they must move up to their Speed and/or perform 1
  Major Action available to them, as directed by the creature that caused the condition.
  Another creature within 6 spaces may use a Major action to end this effect. This
  effect ends automatically if the target is damaged by the creature that caused the
  condition.

  12. **Invisible** When making a Check to detect an Invisible creature, draw with Lower
  Hand. Unless otherwise stated, using a Power ends the Invisible condition. The attack
  that ends Invisibility is drawn at Upper Hand.

  13. **Grappled** Movement speed is reduced to 0 and a Grappled creature cannot gain
  the benefit of additional speed. They have Lower Hand when using any Power. A
  creature can end the Grappled condition by making a successful Contested Brute or
  Finesse Check against target's Brute.

  14. **Dead** If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, they begin an Epic Event. On
  failing the Epic Event, the Dealer is dead in the game world. They live on in the
  Player's memory and the other characters of the world. Players are encouraged to
  create a new Dealer and work with their GM to introduce that character in a future
  session. Some GMs may decide that Player Character *Death* is not part of their story.

### Health and Armor

Dealers have 4 health points (HP) plus their level, plus Vitality modifier. The health
of Companions HP is half the level of their Dealer, rounding up. If a character is
wounded beyond their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor Points (AP) are an
additional resource that would be removed first in the event of a physical wound.

Armor Range (AR) is how hard you are to hit in general and sets the DR for an attack
against you. Without armor, this is 3 minus half of your Agility modifier rounded down.
So if a character has an Agility modifier of +2, their AR would be 2. If you have
physical armor or an armor-like magical effect, this determines your AR depending on the
type of armor. Some armor has strength requirements which, if unmet, will cut a
character's speed in half. Some armor can possess special effects, like granting bonuses
to certain checks or requiring hits to color-match.

Physical shields and magical effects can grant AP, either when equipping the item or
activating the Power. Unless otherwise specified, damage subtracts from AP first. After
AP is depleted, additional damage subtracts from HP. Unless otherwise noted, no two
pieces of armor may be worn at the same time.

**Armor Table**

| Type      | AR | AP | Prerequisite  |
|-----------|----|----|---------------|
| Basic     | 3  | 0  |               |
| Light     | 3  | 1  |               |
| Medium    | 2  | 0  | Strength ≥ 0  |
| Fortified | 2  | 1  | Strength ≥ 0  |
| Heavy     | 1  | 2  | Strength ≥ 1  |
| Massive   | 1  | 3  | Strength ≥ 2  |
| Gleaming  | 1  | 2  | Agility ≥ 3   |

### Epic Events

<!-- Add Knocked Out details -->

At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event. The GM will narrate a particularly
tense scenario and the player(s) must navigate the challenge. This usually involves
player(s) needing to make a series of successes in a short time period. During an Epic
Event...

1. The GM determines the total number of TCs and the amount of successes or failures
needed to complete the Epic Event. The GM then draws a TC related to a specific task
during the event.

2. One or more players may announce how they would attempt this task. The GM decides the
relevant Attribute or Skill, so each player may apply the relevant modifier. The GM
applies no modifier.

3. Each player involved and the GM take turns drawing on this TC, looking for a Suited
Hit. If a player succeeds first, this is a success for the party. If the GM succeeds
first, this is a failure.

4. Powers cannot be used during an Epic Event unless the GM explicitly allows for it in
a specific circumstance.

This process repeats for each TC in the Epic Event. A player may not volunteer for
two TCs in a row. Just as in standard Checks, a failure may be associated with some
drawbacks. Successive failures could change the course of the story. Fate Cards card
mechanics still apply: played Aces return to the player’s hand. Players may use Fate
Cards for redraws or to negate damage taken during the Epic Event.

**For example**, an earthquake causes a cavern to shake. The party must act quickly
  to get out before a collapse

1. The GM reveals a TC: a 4 of Hearts, with DR 4. How will the party navigate their way
to safety?

2. Xena and Elise both volunteer for this TC. Xena will attempt to remember the way
back, and will be making Knowledge Checks. Elise is a skilled survivalist, with
experience in rock formations, and will be making Craft Checks.

    1. Xena draws a 3 of Spades with +0 Mod. This is within the DR, but not a Suited
    Match.

    2. Elise draws a 9 of Hearts with a +1 Mod. This is a Suited Match, the group makes
    good headway.

3. The GM reveals a new TC: a K of Spades, with DR 3. A cultist blocks their path.

4. Genesis volunteers to distract the cultists, using Performance Checks. Genesis and
the GM each draw: Genesis, then the GM, then Genesis, then the GM, etc. Finally, the GM
draws a Q of Spades. This is the first failure. The cultist sees the remaining party
members.

5. The GM reveals a new TC, DR 2. All party members must make Athletics checks to outrun
the cultist.

When a Dealer is Knocked Out in combat, their subsequent turns are replaced with Epic
Event TCs of DR 4 Vitality Checks. If they take additional damage, they make these
checks at Lower Hand (+1). If they succeed on two TCs, they remain unconscious and the
Epic Event is concluded. For a Major Success (same value as TC), they recover 1 HP. For
a Critical Success, they recover 1 HP and up to 3 PP (PP max permitting). If they fail
two of these TCs, they are *Dead* and are called to the great beyond.

### Rests

Rests are common throughout an Adventure. There are two types of rests. A Quick Rest
represents a short 30-minute break of in-game time, where characters may be catching
their breath or healing their wounds. A Full Rest is an 8-hour period of in-game time
where characters get some sleep and recover from a long day.

During a Quick Rest, each player who is resting draws from their deck using Rest Cards.
Players start with a number of Rest Cards equal to their maximum Health. Each Rest Card
can be used as a DR 3 draw against one's own target card without modifiers. On a miss,
recover one HP or PP, your choice. On a success, recover two total points across HP and
PP, your choice.

At the end of a Quick Rest, shuffle the discard pile and draw 10 plus twice Vitality
back into your deck, and then reshuffle your deck. A player can only gain the benefits
of a Quick Rest twice per Full Rest.

After completing a Full Rest, discard your TC, shuffle your discard pile back into your
deck, along with any Aces from your hand. Add both Jokers to your hand as Fate Cards if
they were used. Fate, Health, Power, and Armor Points, as well as Rest Cards, all return
to their maximum values.

### Fatigue

If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you suffer
one level of *Fatigue*. This signifies your character running out of
Stamina during a long day. Consult the list below for the consequences at each level of
fatigue.

1. Lower hand (1) on saves.
2. Lower hand (1) on all checks.
3. Movement halved and Fate Cards cannot be used to gain Upper Hand.
4. PP expenditure requirements doubled.
5. Knocked Out

Upon completing a Full Rest, all levels of Fatigue are removed.

### Discard Powers

Each Dealer may have one Discard Power. Dealers may discard cards as
a Minor Action for additional benefits in combat starting at Level 2. For
every 2 cards discarded, up to a limit of 4, an Upper/Lower Hand +1 is
granted described below. These effects do not stack; only one may be applied
to a character at a time. Cards are discarded and can still yield Fate Cards.

Below is a list of possible Discard Powers, determined by Role. Work with your GM if you
would like to use a different Discard Power instead.
<!-- Specifying in combat until we can revisit non-combat uses of aggro and thwart -->

- **Aggro** (Defender): Discard N cards to force all creatures within 2 spaces to make
  their next Check to attack targets besides the triggering Dealer at Lower Hand (N/2).

- **Help** (Support): Discard N cards to grant an ally within 6 spaces Upper Hand (N/2) on
  all Checks until the end of their next turn.

- **Thwart** (Martial): Discard N cards and cause an enemy within 6 spaces to make all
  Checks at Lower Hand (N/2) until the start of the triggering Dealer's next turn.

- **Intensify** (Caster): On your next Attack, discard cards until you reach a Major Success.
  Standard Successes are treated as Misses. You can choose to end this effect early.

The discard limit increases with level according to the table below.

| Level | Discard Cap | Bonus |
|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----:|
|   1   |      4      |   2   |
|   5   |      6      |   3   |
|   8   |      8      |   4   |

### Interacting with the Environment

#### Light and Vision

Certain types of Checks require light and vision to see the environment or a target
effectively. The amount of light available impacts Checks for most creatures. There are
some Powers that affect a creature's abilities depending on the amount of light
available.

**Partial Darkness:** When making a Detection or Investigation Check in partial
  darkness, draw with the Lower Hand. For example...

- A dark alley in a city with some light spilling over from a nearby street.
- An underground room with some candles burning lightly.

**Full Darkness:** When making a Detection or Investigation Check in full darkness, draw
with the Lower Hand (3). For example...

- A moonless night in the countryside without any light source.
- Descending into a cave without a light source.

**Hidden:** Upon a successful Stealth check a creature is considered *Hidden* with
respect to other creatures. Attacks against unaware creatures have Upper Hand, and
attacks against a Hidden creature have Lower Hand.

Unless otherwise stated, a creature is no longer Hidden whenever another creature makes
a Successful Detection Check or if the creature:

- Uses a Power
- Takes Damage
- Fails a Stealth Check

#### Cover

When a creature moves to a position that makes it more difficult to hit them, they will
gain the effects of cover.

**Partially Covered**: When a creature is still visible behind something but it is still
  reasonable to hit them. While partially covered the creature's AR is reduced by -1,
  making them harder to hit. For example...

- Standing directly between another creature and an attacker.
- Standing behind a crate or barrel that is half the creature's height.

**Fully Covered**: when a creature is nearly impossible to see behind something and it
  is unlikely to land a hit on them. While fully covered, the creature's AR is reduced
  by -2. For example...

- Crouching below a crate that is half the creature's height.
- Standing behind a pillar or wall that is taller than the creature.

A creature can go from Fully to Partially Covered or from Fully Covered to Not Covered
by using their Speed or making a Check. Some Powers may grant these effects as well. A
creature may be covered from one direction but not from another direction, and the GM
determines if a creature is Fully or Partially Covered depending on the scenario.

#### Falling

Falling from a great height is dangerous. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1
damage and applies -1 speed for every 2 space equivalent in height it fell and the
creature is Knocked Down. This speed is recovered after a Rest or if the creature is
healed to their maximum HP. Your GM may allow for an Agility Save to mitigate the
penalty from falling.

#### Challenging Terrain

Moving through the environment can sometimes be challenging. When navigating
through *Challenging Terrain*, moving through one space requires 2 speed. While
standing in Challenging Terrain, all Agility Saves are made with the Lower Hand.

#### Holding Breath

A character can go without air for 1 + 2 times Vitality Mod minutes. Taking damage
without air reduces this time by 1 minute. After this time, the character
gains the *Suffocating* Status Condition.

Some Powers or effects can extend this time limit or prevent a character from
Suffocating.

## Character Creation

Deck of Adventures offers both [premade characters](./PremadeCharacters/README.md) and a
completely customizable process. Consult with your GM for information about the setting
and what skills might be relevant for the story ahead. Custom creation starts with
spending Experience Points on Attributes, Skills, Powers, Vulnerabilities and/or
Skills.

- A [Background](./03_CharacterCreation#decide-your-background) is descriptive of a
  character's history and where they are when you begin your adventure.

- [A Role](./03_CharacterCreation#choose-your-role) is a general class that unlocks
  access to certain abilities.

- Attributes cost more, but also increase corresponding skills.

- Spending points has diminishing returns. Going from 0 to +1 is relatively cheap,
  but +3 to +4 will take many more points.

- Skill Modifiers start *unskilled* with a 0 Modifier, so choose carefully.

- Vulnerabilities are roleplay and/or combat weaknesses and yield 1 or 2 additional
  Experience Points to spend when they are added to the Character Sheet during
  Character Creation.

- Powers are special features, boons or strengths, that cost 1 or 2 Experience Points.
  If a Power has a Power Point cost, add the higher PP value to your total PP. Powers
  may have additional requirements such as Role or Level.

For a full set of character creation options, see our
[Character Creation page](./03_CharacterCreation.md).

### Leveling up

As your character journeys through the world and accumulates experience, they will
*Level Up*. Every character starts at Level 1 and gains experience over time.

When leveling up, characters:

- Add 1 to their maximum HP
- Acquire 2 Experience Points to spend on Attributes, Skills, and Powers
- Can access Powers that require a certain level

Your GM decides when your character achieves a level up. Work with your GM to understand
how leveling up works at your table.

## Starting your adventure

There are four steps to starting an adventure of Deck of Adventures:

1. **Find a group:** Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master
( GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to
the table. Join the Deck of Adventures [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dk6RfWgPHF)
to find a group! (if this link is expired, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=Expired%20Discord%20Link!))

2. **Discuss play style:** Different players and GMs will have different preferences.
Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve
political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch
horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be open to
feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided.

3. **Choose your adventure:** You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures’s standard
adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described
here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited
to make modifications to fit their setting. A GM can also choose to write their own
Adventure in a setting of their choosing.

4. **Pick a time and place:** Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played
in-person as it is online, and if you want to meet online there are virtual tabletop
programs (VTTs) such as Roll20 that you can use that allow you to draw virtual cards.

To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind...

1. **Schedules:** Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving
forward. Session length varies from table to table and is determined by the GM, so make
sure everyone knows how much time to schedule for each session. We suggest using a
calendar or scheduling tool such as a Discord event to help coordinate schedules.

2. **Getting on the same page:** A good ‘first’ session discussion topic is the story
ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should
propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help
your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete
backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the
first official session of play.

3. Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in
their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM
can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and yours to
remember.

### Getting Started

Now that you've read the rules, you're ready to get started with your first Adventure.

You can [make your own character](./03_CharacterCreation.md) or choose from a set of
[premade characters](./PremadeCharacters/README.md) and add your own flavor and
background to them.

Grab some friends and a deck of cards, or visit the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/dk6RfWgPHF) to find a GM and a party for your next
Adventure.

Happy Adventuring!
