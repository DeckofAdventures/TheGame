# Deck of Adventures Quickstart Guide

## What is Deck of Adventures?

Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where friends tell a
collaborative narrative story together as a group of adventurers. This guide is enough
to get started, but we recommend you read the [Full Players Guide](./01_PlayerGuideFull.md)
to learn all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices.

## Quick-Start Guide

Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part.
The GM will be there to help guide you through the process and understand the rules.
The GM serves as the primary storyteller and referee throughout an Adventure.

### The Deck

Grab a **standard deck of playing cards**, reserving the Jokers, and shuffle well. Cards
will be drawn from this deck and make their way to a Discard Pile.

### Checks

If your character attempts an action with an unknown outcome, you'll be asked to make
a **Check**, which involves drawing one more cards from your deck, and comparing the
outcome via...

- A *Target Card* (TC) that is drawn and shown on the table, which you hope to Draw a
  value close to in order to succeed on your Check. Think of it as the bullseye of
  the target you are aiming for.

- *Difficulty Range* (DR) that defines how far away from the Target Card you can be and
  still succeed. Think of it as the closest rings surrounding the bullseye. A DR 'above'
  a King is an Ace, then 2, and so on. A DR 'below' 2 is an Ace, then King, etc.

- A *Modifier* (Mod) is associated with a specific skill or attribute and can be found
  on your character sheet. A mod allows you to add that number to the DR, increasing the
  effective DR and making it easier for you to succeed. This helps widen the rings
  around the bullseye that will result in a successful draw.

- Under some circumstances, you'll be asked to draw with the *Upper Hand* or the *Lower Hand*.
    - With the Upper Hand, you can draw an additional card(s) and use the more
     favorable value to increase your odds.
    - With the Lower Hand, you must draw an additional card(s) and use the less
     favorable value, decreasing your odds.
    - A single instance of Upper Hand or Lower Hand requires you to draw just 1
     additional card. However, these effects can compound, requiring you to draw 2
     or more cards for the applicable check. Upper and Lower Hand can also cancel
     each other out.

- For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5 to succeed
  on a Check. If you have a +1 Mod, the effective DR is 2 which means you can draw a 2,
  3, 4, 5 or 6 and still report a successful draw.

There are two special kinds of Checks:

- A *Contested Check* is triggered by two characters using skills for opposing goals.
  The initiator sets the Target Card (their own card) and the DR (3 - Mod/2). The
  character responding makes a simple check against this TC/DR.

- A *Save* is a Check made with an Attribute (see below) with a predetermined DR that a
  character makes while aiming at their own Target Card.

### Fate Cards

You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as **Fate Cards**. Any Aces drawn during play are
also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to ...

  1. *Push Fate*: redraw any check and use the new value.
  2. *Exchange Fate*: gain one *Power Point* per card discarded (up to your maximum)
  3. *Toughen Up*: nullify one point of damage taken per card discarded.

### Characters

You will have a **Character Sheet** with all the information about your character. This
includes Attributes (general traits, like Agility and Intelligence), and specific
Skills under each Attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility). Each Attribute and Skill has
a Modifier that you add when performing a Check related to that Attribute or Skill,
signified by a number like +1. If a Mod equals 0, do not add or subtract from the DR.

Also on your character sheet are **Powers**. This is anything your character can do
that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or
2 *Power Points* respectively to activate. Your character sheet shows your starting
number of Power Points as your maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many Power
Points you have left as you use Powers.

You can work with your GM to create a custom character for the Adventure, or use one of
the [premade characters](./PremadeCharacters/) as a quick way to get started.

### Gameplay

Throughout an Adventure, your GM will describe scenes and may provide visual cues or
props. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure out what your character
would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact rules) is encouraged.

Different Adventures might involve exploring the world, interacting with the locals, or
resolving conflicts with opposing forces in combat. Adventures may contain a mix of all
of these elements, or be primarily focused on one specific area. These scenarios will
also be determined by the actions and choices of you and the other players at the table.

During an Adventure, the GM might announce an **Epic Event**, a series of trials meant
to represent actions the party might have to take during a tense scenario.

- The GM will reveal a TC and DR. One or more players can volunteer and decide which
  skill they want to use for the relevant check.

- Each player and the GM will take turns drawing on the TC to get a success with a
  matching suit.

- Each TC is a collective success or failure, and the GM determines how many TCs are
  needed to resolve the Epic Event.

At the end of an Epic Event, the GM will tell the party whether they were successful,
and reveal what narrative consequences there are for their success or failure.

### Resting

Your character may need to rest to recharge Power Points or heal Health Points. A Quick
Rest takes 30 minutes of in-game time, while a Full Rest takes 8 hours of in-game time.
If a rest is interrupted, you do not gain the benefits and need to try resting again.

- On completing a **Quick Rest**, each player can draw a number of **Rest Cards**.
    - Each Rest Card is used in a DR 3 check to regain Health or Power Points. 1 point
      is regained on a miss, and 2 points are regained on a success.
    - At the end of the rest, shuffle 10 plus twice your Vitality modifier cards back
      into your deck.

- On completing a **Full Rest** you return to your maximum Health, Fate, Power and Armor
  Points.
    - If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a Rest, you may
     reshuffle your discard pile into your deck, but you gain one level of *Fatigue*.
     This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day.
    - Return all Aces to the deck, and Jokers to your hand and **shuffle**. Some GMs may
    also ask for shuffling on Quick Rests.

Every time you run out of cards during a day and need to reshuffle, you gain one more
level of *Fatigue*, which will make it more difficult to succeed going forward. See the
[Full Players Guide](./01_PlayerGuideFull.md/#status-conditions) to learn more about the
*Fatigued* status condition.

### Combat

During an Adventure, your party may need to navigate conflict with other characters or
groups. If conflict can't be resolved peacefully, it may result in a combat scenario.
The GM decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. A turn
order is implemented and the area of combat is represented as a grid where each space is
equal to 5 square feet. This may be represented on a physical or digital map, or played
out in the "theater of the mind", and will be determined by your GM.

When the GM declares the start of Combat, each character involved in the scenario will
draw a Target Card to determine turn order, starting from Ace and working down to 2.

- On your turn, you can move and take 1 Major and 1 Minor Action, in any order.
  Minor actions include object interactions and some Skill Checks.
- Your movement is limited by the Speed value on your character sheet, showing the
  maximum number of spaces you can move. The average speed is 6.
- Your character sheet will give you optional actions that you can take listed under
  Powers, but you can always try something new using your imagination and knowledge of
  your character and the scenario. Ask your GM if your idea is possible under the
  circumstances.
- Unless otherwise stated, Powers have a range of 6 spaces and do 1 point of damage.
- Remember, if you get hit, you can expend a Fate Card to nullify 1 point of damage.
- Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked Out,
  Blinded/Deafened or Entangled. For a full list of Status Conditions and their rules,
  consult the [Full Players Guide](./01_PlayerGuideFull.md/#status-conditions).
