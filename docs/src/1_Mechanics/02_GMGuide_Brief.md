# GMâ€™s Quickstart Guide to Deck of Adventures

## Introduction

This quickstart guide is designed to help you learn how to get started as a Game Master,
whether you are getting ready to run your first game of Deck of Adventures or if you're
a seasoned veteran of the system.

We believe that everyone is a storyteller, and that anyone can be a Game Master. This
guide provides an accessible, intuitive, and simple approach to what it takes to lead
players through an Adventure as the primary storyteller.

This guide will primarily cover the basics of being a GM. To learn the basic rules of
Deck of Adventures check out the [Player's Quickstart Guide](./01_PlayerGuide_Brief.md)
and the [Full Player's Guide](./01_PlayerGuide_Full.md). If you would like to learn the
in-depth rules of being a Game Master, you can read the [Full GM Guide](./02_GMGuide.md).

Here is an overview of what this guide will cover:

  others.

### Why Deck of Adventures?

While there are many TTRPG systems to choose from, Deck of Adventures is designed to
empower storytellers by providing tools, resources, and access to tell better stories.

When choosing a system, many people look for something that fits their individual
preferences. With Deck of Adventures you can take the rules that are in place and design
something truly custom to fit your needs. Or, if you and your friends want to just sit
down and have a quick and fun session, DofA is a great fit too.  

## At the table setup

These are the steps you should take to set up your space:

1. Prepare space on your table for at least: 2 decks of cards, 2 discard piles, and room
   to reserve Fate Cards.

2. Keep your notes and preparation material behind a GM screen or visual barrier so
   players can't see "behind the screen."

3. Keep this guide and the [Full GM Guide](./02_GMGuide.md) close at hand as a reference.
