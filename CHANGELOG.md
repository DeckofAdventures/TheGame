# Changelog

## General

Deck of Adventures adopts conventions outlined by
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): Major:Minor:Patch. As much of this
convention is specific to software development, we make the following general
adjustments.

1. MAJOR versions are for significant changes that may not be backwards compatible.
2. MINOR versions add significant new backwards compatible features to be tested.
3. PATCH versions are backwards compatible adjustments not yet ready for widespread
   testing.

While untracked edits may change individual pages and patches may systematically change
multiple pages, minor and major versions will be accompanied by descriptors detailing
the nature of these changes.
